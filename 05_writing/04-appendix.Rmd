# Anillaco's Plant Community

Following methods similar to @aranda-rickertExtrafloralNectarFuels2014 a non-extensive survey of the plant community was done in May 2019. Three perpendicular 50m transects were defined near the study site (COORDINATES). A point-intercept method was used to record plant species present in the transects, species right below the sampling points were registered in the data. Sampling points were defined every 1m along the 50m transects. Plant species were identified in the field by a Botanist, except for a few members of the Poaceae family.

The results for the plant survey is in line with what has been described in the literature for the region [@abrahamOverviewGeographyMonte2009; @aranda-rickertExtrafloralNectarFuels2014; @fracchiaDispersalArbuscularMycorrhizal2011]. The results show a dominance of Zygolhyllaceae, Poaceae and Fabaceae families. The relative frequency of plant families and species recorded in the area are shown in the graphs below (Fig. \@ref(fig:appendix-plants)).
