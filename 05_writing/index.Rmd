<!--
Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!

If you'd prefer to not include a Dedication, for example, simply delete the section entirely, or silence (add #) them. 

If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.

If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file enclose it in a block like this.

If you receive a duplicate label error after knitting, make sure to delete the index.Rmd file and then knit again.

```{r include_packages, include = FALSE}
# This chunk ensures that the coppedown package is
# installed and loaded. This coppedown package includes
# the template files for the thesis.
if(!require(devtools))
  install.packages("devtools", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
if(!require(coppedown))
  devtools::install_github("COPPE-UFRJ/coppedown")
library(coppedown)
```

<!-- On ordering the chapter files:
There are two options:
1. Name your chapter files in the order in which you want them to appear (e.g., 01-Inro, 02-Data, 03-Conclusions). 
2. Otherwise, you can specify the order in which they appear in the _bookdown.yml (for PDF only).

Do not include 00(two-hyphens)prelim.Rmd and 00-abstract.Rmd in the YAML file--they are handled in the YAML above differently for the PDF version.
