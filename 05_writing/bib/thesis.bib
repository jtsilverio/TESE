In relation to socio-ecological issues, the focus is on a case study in the province of Mendoza. An analysis is presented about the ecological-economic issues and the sustainable investment policies in rangelands of the Patagonian Monte. In addition, this biome is compared with other South American arid biomes and their North American counterparts. We identified some gaps in the current knowledge, especially at a mesoscale level, where studies on Monte borders are deemed necessary as well as explicit boundary criteria for ecosystem differentiation. Also the ecological-economic relations and feedbacks between livestock herbivory, soil erosion and market behaviour should be considered within the framework of wider socio-ecological research.},

  abstract = {The underground environment poses particular communication challenges for subterranean rodents. Some loud and low-pitched acoustic signals that can travel long distances are appropriate for long-range underground communication and have been suggested to be territorial signals. Long-range vocalizations (LRVs) are important in long-distance communication in               Ctenomys               tuco-tucos. We characterized the LRV of the Anillaco Tuco-Tuco (               Ctenomys               sp.) using recordings from free-living individuals and described the behavioral context in which this vocalization was produced during laboratory staged encounters between individuals of both sexes. Long-range calls of Anillaco tuco-tucos are low-frequency, broad-band, loud, and long sounds composed by the repetition of two syllable types: series (formed by notes and soft-notes) and individual notes. All vocalizations were initiated with series, but not all had individual notes. Males were heavier than females and gave significantly lower-pitched vocalizations, but acoustic features were independent of body mass in males. The pronounced variation among individuals in the arrangement and number of syllables and the existence of three types of series (dyads, triads, and tetrads), created a diverse collection of syntactic patterns in vocalizations that would provide the opportunity to encode multiple types of information. The existence of complex syntactic patterns and the description of soft-notes represent new aspects of the vocal communication of               Ctenomys               . Long-distance vocalizations by Anillaco Tuco-Tucos appear to be territorial signals used mostly in male-male interactions. First, emission of LRVs resulted in de-escalation or space-keeping in male-male and male-female encounters in laboratory experiments. Second, these vocalizations were produced most frequently (in the field and in the lab) by males in our study population. Third, males produced LRVs with greater frequency during male-male encounters compared to male-female encounters. Finally, males appear to have larger home ranges that were more spatially segregated than those of females, suggesting that males may have greater need for long-distance signals that advertise their presence. Due to their apparent rarity, the function and acoustic features of LRV in female tuco-tucos remain inadequately known.},

  abstract = {The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which serves as the central pacemaker in mammals, regulates the 24-h rhythm in behavioral activity. However, it is currently unclear whether and how bouts of activity and rest are regulated within the 24-h cycle (i.e., over ultradian time scales). Therefore, we used passive infrared sensors to measure temporal behavior in mice housed under either a light\textendash dark (LD) cycle or continuous darkness (DD). We found that a probabilistic Markov model captures the ultradian changes in the behavioral state over a 24-h cycle. In this model, the animal's behavioral state in the next time interval is determined solely by the animal's current behavioral state and by the ``toss'' of a proverbial ``biased coin.'' We found that the bias of this ``coin'' is regulated by light input and by the phase of the clock. Moreover, the bias of this ``coin'' for an animal is related to the average length of rest and activity bouts in that animal. In LD conditions, the average length of rest bouts was greater during the day compared to during the night, whereas the average length of activity bouts was greater during the night compared to during the day. Importantly, we also found that day-night changes in the rest bout lengths were significantly greater than day-night changes in the activity bout lengths. Finally, in DD conditions, the activity and rest bouts also differed between subjective night and subjective day, albeit to a lesser extent compared to LD conditions. The ultradian regulation represented by the model does not result in ultradian rhythms, although some weak ultradian rhythms are present in the data. The persistent differences in bout length over the circadian cycle following loss of the external LD cycle indicate that the central pacemaker plays a role in regulating rest and activity bouts on an ultradian time scale.},

However, their distribution and abundance in deserts are poorly known. In this study, we test the predictions that biotic interactions between EFN plants and ants are abundant and common also in arid communities and that EFNs are only functional when new vegetative and reproductive structures are developing. In a seasonal desert of northwestern Argentina, we surveyed the richness and phenology of EFN plants and their associated ants and examined the patterns in ant \textendash{} plant interaction networks. We found that 25 ant species and 11 EFN-bearing plant species were linked together through 96 pairs of associations. Plants bearing EFNs were abundant, representing ca. 19 \% of the species encountered in transects and 24 \% of the plant cover. Most ant species sampled (ca. 77 \%) fed on EF nectar. Interactions showed a marked seasonal pattern: EFN secretion was directly related to plant phenology and correlated with the time of highest ant ground activity. Our results reveal that EFN-mediated interactions are ecologically relevant components of deserts, and that EFN-bearing plants are crucial for the survival of desert ant communities.},

It rests on periodic processeswhich have the characteristics of self-sustaining oscillations, and which, in constant conditions, free-run with periods slightly deviating from 24 h. When entrained to 24h, thesecircadian rhythms can be used by the organism as a clock for temporal 0rientation.e.g. in the occupation of one of the temporal nichesprovided by the environment or in the coordination of activitiesamong individuals and species.The circadian clock also provides the basisfor using the sun as a compass in spatial orientation, and for the recognition of the time of day asexemplified by the time sensein honey bees.Within the human organism, almost every function is modulated in a circadian fashion. Usually, all rhythms keep a distinct phaserelationship to eachother, providing a high degreeof temporal order within the organism. When living in an isolation unit without time cues,most subjectsdevelop free-running rhythms with periods closeto 25 h in all functions. Sometimes, however, the sleep-wake cycleis lengthened to 30 h and more, or shortened to lessthan 22 h. In those instances,other rhythms suchasthat of body temperature become uncoupled from the sleep-wake cycleand continue to free-run with a period of about 25 h. During such statesof `internal desynchronization', subjectscan be awake continuously for about 32 h, and sleepwithout interruption for 16h. Nevertheless,they experiencetheir `days' asequal to 24 h. This is due to a profound change in time estimation: the intervals of 1-h estimatesmade by the subjectare positively correlated with the duration of wakefulness. In contrast, short-time estimates (in the range of seconds) remain unaffected by desynchronization, indicating that short- and long-time estimates are based on different mechanisms.},

  abstract = {State-space models (SSMs) are an important modeling framework for analyzing ecological time series. These hierarchical models are commonly used to model population dynamics, animal movement, and capture-recapture data, and are now increasingly being used to model other ecological processes. SSMs are popular because they are flexible and they model the natural variation in ecological processes separately from observation error. Their flexibility allows ecologists to model continuous, count, binary, and categorical data with linear or nonlinear processes that evolve in discrete or continuous time. Modeling the two sources of stochasticity separately allows researchers to differentiate between biological variation (e.g., in birth processes) and imprecision in the sampling methodology, and generally provides better estimates of the ecological quantities of interest than if only one source of stochasticity is directly modeled. Since the introduction of SSMs, a broad range of fitting procedures have been proposed. However, the variety and complexity of these procedures can limit the ability of ecologists to formulate and fit their own SSMs. We provide the knowledge for ecologists to create SSMs that are robust to common, and often hidden, estimation problems, and the model selection and validation tools that can help them assess how well their models fit their data. In this paper, we present a review of SSMs that will provide a strong foundation to ecologists interested in learning about SSMs, introduce new tools to veteran SSM users, and highlight promising research directions for statisticians interested in ecological applications. The review is accompanied by an in-depth tutorial that demonstrates how SSMs models can be fitted and validated in R. Together, the review and tutorial present an introduction to SSMs that will help ecologists to formulate, fit, and validate their models.},

One is diurnal and the other is relatively nocturnal. In the first experiment, the authors found that these patterns are strongly influenced by parentage and by sex. Specifically, offspring of two nocturnal parents were significantly more likely to express a nocturnal pattern of wheel-running than were offspring of diurnal parents, and more females than males were nocturnal. In the second experiment, the authors found that diurnal and nocturnal wheel-runners were indistinguishable with respect to the timing of postpartum mating, which always occurred in the hours before lights-on. Here they also found that both juvenile and adult A. niloticus exhibited diurnal patterns of general activity when housed without a wheel, even if they exhibited nocturnal activity when housed with a wheel. In the third experiment, the authors discovered that adult female A. niloticus with nocturnal patterns of wheel-running were also nocturnal with respect to general activity and core body temperature when a running wheel was available, but they were diurnal when the running wheel was removed. Finally, a field study revealed that all A. niloticus were almost exclusively diurnal in their natural habitat. Together these results suggest that individuals of this species are fundamentally diurnal but that access to a running wheel shifts some individuals to a nocturnal pattern.},

  abstract = {Photoperiodism is the ability of organisms to assess and use the day length as an anticipatory cue to time seasonal events in their life histories. Photoperiodism is especially important in initiating physiological and developmental processes that are typically irrevocable and that culminate at a future time or at a distant place; the further away in space or time, the more likely a seasonal event is initiated by photoperiod. The pervasiveness of photoperiodism across broad taxa, from rotifers to rodents, and the predictable changes of photoperiodic response with geography identify it as a central component of fitness in temperate and polar seasonal environments. Consequently, the role of day length cannot be disregarded when evaluating the mechanisms underlying life-historical events, range expansions, invasions of novel species, and response to climate change among animals in the temperate and polar regions of the world.},

  abstract = {Behavior is an important mechanism of evolution and it is paid for through energy expenditure. Nevertheless, field biologists can rarely observe animals for more than a fraction of their daily activities and attempts to quantify behavior for modeling ecological processes often exclude cryptic yet important behavioral events. Over the past few years, an explosion of research on remote monitoring of animal behavior using acceleration sensors has smashed the decades-old limits of observational studies. Animal-attached accelerometers measure the change in velocity of the body over time and can quantify fine-scale movements and body postures unlimited by visibility, observer bias, or the scale of space use. Pioneered more than a decade ago, application of accelerometers as a remote monitoring tool has recently surged thanks to the development of more accessible hardware and software. It has been applied to more than 120 species of animals to date. Accelerometer measurements are typically collected in three dimensions of movement at very high resolution ({$>$}10~Hz), and have so far been applied towards two main objectives. First, the patterns of accelerometer waveforms can be used to deduce specific behaviors through animal movement and body posture. Second, the variation in accelerometer waveform measurements has been shown to correlate with energy expenditure, opening up a suite of scientific questions in species notoriously difficult to observe in the wild. To date, studies of wild aquatic species outnumber wild terrestrial species and analyses of social behaviors are particularly few in number. Researchers of domestic and captive species also tend to report methodology more thoroughly than those studying species in the wild. There are substantial challenges to getting the most out of accelerometers, including validation, calibration, and the management and analysis of large quantities of data. In this review, we illustrate how accelerometers work, provide an overview of the ecological questions that have employed accelerometry, and highlight the emerging best practices for data acquisition and analysis. This tool offers a level of detail in behavioral studies of free-ranging wild animals that has previously been impossible to achieve and, across scientific disciplines, it improves understanding of the role of behavioral mechanisms in ecological and evolutionary processes.},

  abstract = {Circadian clocks are a near-ubiquitous feature of biology, allowing organisms to optimise their physiology to make the most efficient use of resources and adjust behaviour to maximise survival over the solar day. To fulfil this role, circadian clocks require information about time in the external world. This is most reliably obtained by measuring the pronounced changes in illumination associated with the earth's rotation. In mammals, these changes are exclusively detected in the retina and are relayed by direct and indirect neural pathways to the master circadian clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei. Recent work reveals a surprising level of complexity in this sensory control of the circadian system, including the participation of multiple photoreceptive pathways conveying distinct aspects of visual and/or time-of-day information. In this Review, I summarise these important recent advances, present hypotheses as to the functions and neural origins of these sensory signals, highlight key challenges for future research and discuss the implications of our current knowledge for animals and humans in the modern world.},

This can be confusing though, as data from experiments performed in a laboratory environment are sometimes different from, or completely opposite to, findings from similar experiments performed in the ``real world''. In this mini-review, we discuss instances where results from laboratory experiments differ as a result of laboratory housing conditions, and where they differ from results gathered in the field environment. Experiments involving endocrinology and behavior appear to be particularly susceptible to influence from the environment in which they are performed. As such, we have attempted to promote discussion of the influence of housing environment on the reproductive axis, circadian biology and behavior, immune function, stress biology, neuroplasticity and photoperiodism. For example, why should a rodent species be diurnal in one housing environment yet nocturnal in another? Are data that are gathered from experiments in the laboratory applicable to the field environment, and vice-versa? We hope not only to highlight the need for experiments in both lab and field when looking at complex biological systems, but also to promote frank discussion of discordant data. Perhaps, just as study of individual variation has been gaining momentum in recent years, data from variation between experimental arenas can provide us with novel lines of research.},

  abstract = {Background: The typical mandate in conservation planning is to identify areas that represent biodiversity targets within the smallest possible area of land or sea, despite the fact that area may be a poor surrogate for the cost of many conservation actions. It is also common for priorities for conservation investment to be identified without regard to the particular conservation action that will be implemented. This demonstrates inadequate problem specification and may lead to inefficiency: the cost of alternative conservation actions can differ throughout a landscape, and may result in dissimilar conservation priorities. Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigate the importance of formulating conservation planning problems with objectives and cost data that relate to specific conservation actions. We identify priority areas in Australia for two alternative conservation actions: land acquisition and stewardship. Our analyses show that using the cost surrogate that most closely reflects the planned conservation action can cut the cost of achieving our biodiversity goals by half. We highlight spatial differences in relative priorities for land acquisition and stewardship in Australia, and provide a simple approach for determining which action should be undertaken where. Conclusions/Significance: Our study shows that a poorly posed conservation problem that fails to pre-specify the planned conservation action and incorporate cost a priori can lead to expensive mistakes. We can be more efficient in achieving conservation goals by clearly specifying our conservation objective and parameterising the problem with economic data that reflects this objective.},

  abstract = {Dynamic energy budget individual-based models (DEB-IBMs) provide a well-tested framework for modelling the acquisition and use of energy throughout the life cycle of organisms. These models are often developed using species-specific data to link behaviour and physiology and predict how individuals and populations perform in changing environments. Novel bio-logging technology, applied to free-ranging animals, provide detailed information about individual behavioural variations and responses to the environment. However, so far, no DEBIBM has attempted to link and parameterise energy dynamics with the fine-scale activity data obtained by biologging to answer questions related to life history events in wild populations. The aim of this study is, therefore, to develop and test a DEB-IBM framework which integrates individuals behaviour obtained from high-resolution activity data. Our approach uses data collected with GPS and accelerometer tags attached to two muskox (Ovibos moschatus). The individuals had different fates: one survived the Arctic winter, while the other died. Applying hidden Markov models to accelerometer data, we quantified the variation in behavioural activity budgets (in stationary, feeding and transit) in relation to environmental conditions. We subsequently test how differences in time allocation affect fitness outcomes such as body mass, energy reserves and survival. The proportion of time spent feeding by each animal is used within the DEB-IBM framework to scale the functional response for food acquisition. Simulations using the seasonal feeding budget of the deceased individual lead to drastically reduced energy reserves and body weight during the Arctic winter, and to elevated probabilities of mortality by the end of winter. In contrast, simulations using the seasonal feeding pattern of the surviving muskox, result in much less pronounced losses in reserves and body weight, leading to negligible over-winter mortality. The framework we present here uses standardized modelling techniques, is applicable across species and can easily be extended to include other fitness measures or environmental stressors. Moreover, our framework provides the foundation needed for future studies to link individual movements, energetic processes, life history events and population dynamics in wildlife, which would open up possibilities to test how changing (future) environmental conditions influence animal decision-making and ultimately population level consequences.},

We review studies of phenology, thermal biology, and microhabitat selection as examples to illustrate the utility of a biologging approach in terrestrial and aquatic species. These examples show that biologgers can be used to identify and predict behavioral and physiological responses to climatic variation and directional climate change, as well as to extreme weather events. While there is still considerable debate as to whether phenotypic plasticity is sufficient to facilitate species' responses to climate change or whether responses to short-term climate variability are predictive of climate change response, understanding the scope and nature of plasticity is an important step toward answering these questions. One advantage of the biologging approach is that it can facilitate the measurement of traits at the level of the individual, permitting research that investigates the degree to which physiology and behavior are plastic. As such, combining biologging with metrics of fitness can provide insight into how plasticity might confer population and species resilience to climate change. Increased use of biologgers in experimental manipulations will also yield important insight into how phenotypic flexibility allows some animals to mitigate the negative consequences of climate change. Although biologging studies to date have mostly functioned in measuring phenotypic responses to short-term climate variability, we argue that integrating biologging technology into long-term monitoring programs will be instrumental in documenting and understanding ecological responses to climate change.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the behavior of motile, free-ranging animals is difficult. The accelerometry technique offers a method for recording behaviors but interpretation of the data is not straightforward. To date, analysis of such data has either involved subjective, study-specific assignments of behavior to acceleration data or the use of complex analyses based on machine learning. Here, we present a method for automatically classifying acceleration data to represent discrete, coarse-scale behaviors. The method centers on examining the shape of histograms of basic metrics readily derived from acceleration data to objectively determine threshold values by which to separate behaviors. Through application of this method to data collected on two distinct species with greatly differing behavioral repertoires, kittiwakes, and humans, the accuracy of this approach is demonstrated to be very high, comparable to that reported for other automated approaches already published. The method presented offers an alternative to existing methods as it uses biologically grounded arguments to distinguish behaviors, it is objective in determining values by which to separate these behaviors, and it is simple to implement, thus making it potentially widely applicable. The R script coding the method is provided.},

  abstract = {The current biodiversity crisis is characterized by the decline and extinction of numerous animal populations and species world-wide. To aid in understanding the threats and causes of population decline and the assessment of endangerment status of a species, conservation scientists and practitioners are increasingly relying on remote assessments using biotelemetry (radio telemetry, acoustic telemetry, satellite tracking) and biologging (archival loggers) or hybrid technologies (e.g. pop-up satellite tags). These tools offer increasingly sophisticated means (e.g. large-scale telemetry arrays, fine-scale positioning, and use of physiological and environmental sensors) of evaluating the behaviour, spatial ecology, energetics, and physiology of free-living animals in their natural environment. Regional, national, and international threat assessments (e.g. the International Union for the Conservation of Nature [IUCN] Red List) require basic knowledge of animal distribution, emigration, behaviour, reproductive potential, mortality rates, and habitat use, which in many cases can all be obtained through biotelemetry and biologging studies. Such studies are particularly useful for understanding the basic biology of animals living in harsh environments (e.g. polar regions, aquatic environments), for rapidly moving or cryptic animals, and for those that undertake large-scale movements/migrations (e.g. birds, insects, marine mammals and fish). The premise of this paper is that biotelemetry and biologging have much to offer and should be embraced by the conservation science community to aid in assessment of threats and endangerment status. It is crucial that studies on endangered species must not further contribute to species decline or retard recovery. As such, there are complicated ethical and legal considerations that must be considered prior to implementing tracking studies on endangered wildlife. Furthermore, as many endangered animal species occur in developing countries, there is a need to develop capacity (financial support for the research and technical telemetry skills) for designing and conducting tracking studies. To stem the loss of biodiversity and aid in the recovery of endangered animal populations, there is a need for innovative and interdisciplinary research, monitoring programs and research initiatives to inform decision makers. It is clear that biotelemetry and biologging are not a panacea; however, they are valuable tools available to conservation practitioners. Used appropriately, biotelemetry and biologging have the potential to provide data that is often unattainable using other techniques, and can reduce uncertainty in the assignment of conservation status.},

  abstract = {Summary 1. The common vole,Microtus arvalis, like other vole species, in captivity has a short-term activity rhythm in daytime, with a period of circa two hours. Trapping records show that this rhythm exists also in field conditions, with the population in synchrony to some degree; a correlation of trapping frequency with vole predation by kestrels indicates that it reflects the true natural behaviour. 2. Lehmann's (1976) evidence inMicrotus agrestis that the short-term activity rhythm is essentially a feeding rhythm is supported for the common vole by separate recording of wheel running, feeding and nestbox occupation. 3. The short-term rhythm is phase-locked to dawn. There is fair intraindividual constancy from day to day in the timing of meals, but interindividual variation causes a gradual breakdown of population synchrony in the course of the day, both in the field and in captive isolation. 4. The frequency of the rhythm may be evolutionarily adjusted to metabolic demands of the species, as suggested by its dependence on body weight, but remains relatively invariant in the face of experimental (temperature) manipulation of metabolic expenditure. In the absence of food during the day, feeding attempts recur with the same timing as meals did before: periodic changes in satiety, related to food intake and digestion are insufficient to account for such changes in feeding motivation. 5. The risk of being killed by a kestrel is lower for voles active in phase with the population majority than for voles out of phase with the population: there is safety in numbers. Numbers vary dramatically in vole populations, however, and the generality of predatory selection for prey synchrony remains to be tested. 6. Foraging behaviour of the common vole is regulated by a circadian timing system even though feeding is spread evenly over night and day. The adaptive advantage of circadian entrustment with the timing of feeding motivation above meal timing by digestive processes is sought in the individual repetition of daily patterns as the optimal strategic answer to temporal day-to-day correlations in the environment.},

We estimated the daily hours of activity, the percentage of diurnal and nocturnal activity, and the daily activity range and time overlap using time as a circular variable in kernel density estimations. We assessed differences between seasons, sexes, age classes, and types of rearing. The average daily hours of activity was 8:43 h. Camera-traps and radio-telemetry showed similar results. Animals exhibited both diurnal (60\textendash 65\%) and nocturnal (40\textendash 35\%) activity. The higher probability for being active ranged within 09:00\textendash 03:00 h. Anteaters spent more hours active and were more nocturnal during summer. Activity was highly overlapped between sexes, and wild-reared individuals were more nocturnal than captive-reared ones. Seasonal shifts in daily activity highlights the importance of thermoregulation as a selective factor in this species. The giant anteater is a cathemeral species with flexibility to accommodate its activity pattern to local conditions or experience.},

Anthropogenic light and noise have modified differences between day and night, and may thereby interfere with circadian clocks. Urbanized species, such as birds, are known to advance their activity to early morning and night hours. We hypothesized that such modified activity patterns are reflected by properties of the endogenous circadian clock. Using automatic radio-telemetry, we tested this idea by comparing activity patterns of free-living forest and city European blackbirds (Turdus merula). We then recaptured the same individuals and recorded their activity under constant conditions. City birds started their activity earlier and had faster but less robust circadian oscillation of locomotor activity than forest conspecifics. Circadian period length predicted start of activity in the field, and this relationship was mainly explained by fast-paced and early-rising city birds. Although based on only two populations, our findings point to links between city life, chronotype and circadian phenotype in songbirds, and potentially in other organisms that colonize urban habitats, and highlight that urban environments can significantly modify biologically important rhythms in wild organisms.},

An overview about the whole project and its parts like sensor node design, tracking grid and software infrastructure is given and the evaluation of the project is shown. The BATS project includes a lightweight sensor node that is attached to bats and combines multiple features. Communication among sensor nodes allows tracking of bat encounters. Flight trajectories of individual tagged bats can be recorded at high spatial and temporal resolution by a ground node grid. To increase the communication range, the BATS project implemented a long-range telemetry system to still receive sensor data outside the standard ground node network. The whole system is designed with the common goal of ultra-low energy consumption while still maintaining optimal measurement results. To this end, the system is designed in a flexible way and is able to adapt its functionality according to the current situation. In this way, it uses the energy available on the sensor node as efficient as possible.},

  abstract = {The dynamic environmental conditions in highly seasonal systems likely have a strong influence on how species use the landscape. Animals must balance seasonal and daily changes to landscape risk with the underlying resources provided by that landscape. One way to balance the seasonal and daily changes in the costs and benefits of a landscape is through behaviorally-explicit resource selection and temporal partitioning. Here, we test whether resource selection of coyotes (Canis latrans) in Cape Breton Highlands National Park, Nova Scotia, Canada is behaviorally-explicit and responsive to the daily and seasonal variation to presumed costs and benefits of moving on the landscape. We used GPS data and local convex hulls to estimate space use and Hidden Markov Models to estimate three types of movement behavior: encamped, foraging, and traveling. We then used integrated step-selection analysis to investigate behaviorally explicit resource selection across times of day (diurnal, crepuscular, and nocturnal) and season (snow-free and snow). We found that throughout the day and seasonally coyotes shifted foraging behavior and altered behavior and resource choices to avoid moving across what we could be a challenging landscape. These changes in behavior suggest that coyotes have a complex response to land cover, terrain, and linear corridors that are not only scale dependent but also vary by behavior, diel period, and season. By examining the resource selection across three axes (behavior, time of day, and season), we have a more nuanced understanding of how a predator balances the cost and benefits of a stochastic environment.},

Typically, such patterns of activity are thought to be entrained by light cues, raising intriguing questions about the nature of circadian rhythms in subterranean species, members of which spend virtually their entire lives in dark, underground burrows. As part of ongoing studies of the behavioural biology of the Rio Negro tuco-tuco (Ctenomys rionegrensis), we used data from free-living animals to characterize daily patterns of activity in this subterranean species of rodent. The locations of 5 radiocollared adults were recorded hourly for 72 consecutive hours during November, 2005. Analyses of 5 measures of activity based on these data revealed that individuals changed locations more often and moved greater distances between successive radio fixes during daylight hours. These data are consistent with studies of other ctenomyid rodents in suggesting that C. rionegrensis tends toward diurnality. Comparisons with other lineages of subterranean rodents indicate that activity patterns vary markedly among these burrow-dwelling mammals, with substantial intra- as well as inter-specific differences in activity reported.},

Aboveground activity started on average 3.9 h (SD 0.6 h, n = 37 days) after civil twilight at dawn and ended on average 3.2 h (SD 0.9 h, n = 37 days) before civil twilight at dusk. Between onset and offset of activity, 54\% was spent aboveground, of which 73\% was spent foraging. Activity patterns were influenced by photoperiod, rainfall, and by reproductive state. During mating, reproductively active males started activity earlier than females and reproductively inactive males. For females, time spent foraging was high during lactation. The midpoint of daily activity was at 12:16 h (SD 0.37 h, n = 37 days). Activity patterns of European ground squirrels thus appear robustly positioned in the middle of the photoperiod.},

Reproductive status of females was evaluated using a combined approach of vaginal smears, urinary progesterone and oestradiol, and ovarian histology. Behaviours denoting attraction (`male sniff ' and `mount attempts') and mutual courtship behaviours (`spin' and copula) were correlated with vaginal cytology before and oestradiol and progesterone levels in urine 12 h after male\textendash female encounter. After 24 h of the interaction, oestradiol levels and vaginal epithelization increased while progesterone levels decreased in soliciting females. C. talarum females' reproductive behaviour was related to its physiological reproductive state and vaginal cytology. The kind of male interaction, whether couples copulated or remained indifferent affected the later status of females. Females are induced ovulators by mating but male presence and interaction also affected other components of their reproductive physiology such as ovarian hormones and vaginal cytology.},

Our observations of tuco-tucos (Ctenomys aff. knighti) in a field enclosure indicated that these animals perceive the aboveground light-dark cycle by several bouts of light-exposure at irregular times during the light hours of the day. To assess whether such light-dark pattern acts as an entraining agent of the circadian clock, we first constructed in laboratory the Phase Response Curve for 1 h light-pulses (1000lux). Its shape is qualitatively similar to other curves reported in the literature and to our knowledge it is the first Phase Response Curve of a subterranean rodent. Computer simulations were performed with a non-linear limit-cycle oscillator subjected to a simple model of the light regimen experienced by tuco-tucos. Results showed that synchronization is achieved even by a simple regimen of a single daily light pulse scattered uniformly along the light hours of the day. Natural entrainment studies benefit from integrated laboratory, field and computational approaches.},

Several studies have shown the importance of small mammals as consumers and dispersal agents of mycorrhizal fungi spores in tropical and temperate ecosystems. However, little is known about the dispersal of infective propagules of endophytic fungi in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. This study analyzed the potential role of the subterranean rodent Ctenomys cf. knighti as a dispersal agent of root-associated fungi. In order to demonstrate this role, we analyzed: (1) the incidence of colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizae and dark septate endophytes on representative plant species of the Monte Desert; (2) the presence of fungal structures of arbuscular mycorrhizae and dark septate endophytes in C. cf. knighti fecal samples; and (3) the infectivity of the fungal propagules contained in the scat and their growth effects on nine native plant species. Data strongly suggest that this South American subterranean rodent may play a key role as a dispersal agent of arbuscular mycorrhizae and dark septate endophytes fungi in the arid environment of the northern Monte Desert of Argentina.},

Given the importance of niche partitioning for facilitating coexistence between sympatric species, understanding how emerging environmental stressors \textendash{} climate and landscape change, biodiversity loss and concomitant changes to community composition \textendash{} affect temporal niche partitioning is of immediate importance for advancing ecological theory and informing management decisions. A large variety of analytical approaches have been applied to camera-trap data to ask key questions about species activity patterns and temporal overlap among heterospecifics. Despite the many advances for describing and quantifying these temporal patterns, few studies have explicitly tested how interacting biotic and abiotic variables influence species' activity and capacity to segregate along the temporal niche axis. To address this gap, we suggest coordinated distributed experiments to capture sufficient camera-trap data across a range of anthropogenic stressors and community compositions. This will facilitate a standardized approach to assessing the impacts of multiple variables on species' behaviours and interactions. Ultimately, further integration of spatial and temporal analyses of camera-trap data is critical for improving our understanding of how anthropogenic activities and landscape changes are altering competitive interactions and the dynamics of animal communities.},

  abstract = {Organisms experience dramatic fluctuations in demands and stresses over the course of the day. In order to maintain biological processes within physiological boundaries, mechanisms have evolved for anticipation of, and adaptation to, these daily fluctuations. Endocrine factors have an integral role in homeostasis. Not only do circulating levels of various endocrine factors oscillate over the 24\,h period, but so too does responsiveness of target tissues to these signals or stimuli. Emerging evidence suggests that these daily endocrine oscillations do not occur solely in response to behavioural fluctuations associated with sleep\textendash wake and feeding\textendash fasting cycles, but are orchestrated by an intrinsic timekeeping mechanism known as the circadian clock. Disruption of circadian clocks by genetic and/or environmental factors seems to precipitate numerous common disorders, including the metabolic syndrome and cancer. Collectively, these observations suggest that strategies designed to realign normal circadian rhythmicities hold potential for the treatment of various endocrine-related disorders.},

However, direct adaptation of methods from previous studies for use in crested macaques should be taken with caution. We conducted an experiment to assess the accuracy and stability of fecal estrogen metabolite (E1C) and glucocorticoid metabolite (GCM) concentrations in response to several preservation parameters: (1) time lag between sample collection and fecal preservation; (2) long-term storage of fecal samples in 80\% methanol (MeOH) at ambient temperature; (3) different degrees of feces drying temperature using a conventional oven; and (4) different fecal preservation techniques (i.e., freeze-drying, oven-drying, and field-friendly extraction method) and extraction solvents (methanol, ethanol, and commercial alcohol). The study used fecal samples collected from crested macaques (Macaca nigra) living in the Tangkoko Reserve, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Samples were assayed using validated E1C and GCM enzyme immunoassays. Concentrations of E1C and GCM in unprocessed feces stored at ambient temperature remained stable for up to 8 h of storage after which concentrations of both E1C and GCM changed significantly compared to controls extracted at time 0. Long-term storage in 80\% MeOH at ambient temperature affected hormone concentrations significantly with concentrations of both E1C and GCM increasing after 6 and 4 months of storage, respectively. Drying fecal samples using a conventional oven at 50, 70, and 90 \textdegree C did not affect the E1C concentrations, but led to a significant decline for GCM concentrations in samples dried at 90 \textdegree C. Different fecal preservation techniques and extraction solvents provided similar results for both E1C and GCM concentrations. Our results confirm previous studies that prior to application of fecal hormone analysis in a new species, several preservation parameters should be evaluated for their effects on hormone metabolite stability. The results also provide several options for fecal preservation, extraction, and storage methods that can be selected depending on the condition of the field site and laboratory.},

However, even in species that use photoperiodic changes to adjust reproductive functions, winter breeding has been recorded frequently and most likely is caused by different responses to changes in photoperiod. Furthermore, these reproductive phenotypes show clear physiologic and morphologic differences. We investigated winter reproduction in natural populations of 2 European rodents, the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) and the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus). Analyses of our data indicate that winter breeding was due to nonresponsive phenotypes in both sexes. A broad range of gonadal changes was found, particularly in males, and individual differences in testis size were linked to differences in body weight. Population genetic analyses provided no hint of assortative mating between the 2 phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Circadian systems in a wide variety of organisms all appear to include three basic components: 1) biological oscillators that maintain a self-sustained circadian periodicity in the absence of environmental time cues; 2) input pathways that convey environmental information, especially light cues, that can entrain the circadian oscillations to local time; and 3) output pathways that drive overt circadian rhythms, such as the rhythms of locomotor activity and a variety of endocrine rhythms. In mammals, the circadian system is employed in the regulation of reproductive physiology and behavior in two very important ways. 1) In some species, there is a strong circadian component in the timing of ovulation and reproductive behavior, ensuring that these events will occur at a time when the animal is most likely to encounter a potential mate. 2) Many mammals exhibit seasonal reproductive rhythms that are largely under photoperiod regulation; in these species, the circadian system and the pineal gland are crucial components of the mechanism that is used to measure day length. The rhythm of pineal melatonin secretion is driven by a neural pathway that includes the circadian oscillator(s) in the suprachiasmatic nuclei. Melatonin is secreted at night in all mammals, and the duration of each nocturnal episode of melatonin secretion is inversely related to day length. The pineal melatonin rhythm appears to serve as an internal signal that represents day length and that is capable of regulating a variety of seasonal variations in physiology and behavior. \textcopyright{} 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

  abstract = {Photoperiodism is a process whereby organisms are able to use both absolute measures of day length and the direction of day length change as a basis for regulating seasonal changes in physiology and behavior. The use of day length cues allows organisms to essentially track time-of-year and to ``anticipate'' relatively predictable annual variations in important environmental parameters. Thus, adaptive types of seasonal biological changes can be molded through evolution to fit annual environmental cycles. Studies of the formal properties of photoperiodic mechanisms have revealed that most organisms use circadian oscillators to measure day length. Two types of paradigms, designated as the external and internal coincidence models, have been proposed to account for photoperiodic time measurement by a circadian mechanism. Both models postulate that the timing of light exposure, rather than the total amount of light, is critical to the organism's perception of day length. In mammals, a circadian oscillator(s) in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus receives photic stimuli via the retinohypothalamic tract. The circadian system regulates the rhythmic secretion of the pineal hormone, melatonin. Melatonin is secreted at night, and the duration of secretion varies in inverse relation to day length; thus, photoperiod information is ``encoded'' in the melatonin signal. The melatonin signal is presumably ``decoded'' in melatonin target tissues that are involved in the regulation of a variety of seasonal responses. Variations in photoperiodic response are seen not only between species but also between breeding populations within a species and between individuals within single breeding populations. Sometimes these variations appear to be the result of differences in responsiveness to melatonin; in other cases, variations in photoperiod responsiveness may depend on differences in patterns of melatonin secretion related to circadian variation. Sites of action for melatonin in mammals are not yet well characterized, but potential targets of particular interest include the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland and the suprachiasmatic nuclei. Both these sites exhibit uptake of radiolabeled melatonin in various species, and there is some evidence for direct action of melatonin at these sites. However, it appears that there are species differences with respect to the importance and specific functions of various melatonin target sites.},

  abstract = {During the past several years, the noninvasive measurement of steroid metabolites from mammalian feces and bird droppings has become more and more popular. With an increasing acceptance of the method, investigators may become less aware of the need to validate their assays. It is shown why such validations are essential for each new species investigated and various ways to physiologically validate such noninvasive methods are described. Using the European stonechat (Saxicola torquata rubicola) as a model, it is explained why a validated method to measure androgen metabolites in males does not necessarily work in females. In addition the difficulties that may be neglected owing to the superficial ease of sampling and processing of excreta are investigated. Various issues that may arise during sampling, storage, and extraction of excreta are addressed. Finally, results suggesting that experimental manipulations of the diet may affect hormone metabolite levels in European stonechats are presented. So far, only a few studies have investigated the impact of diet on hormone metabolite levels, and these are the first data to report such an impact in birds. More studies are urgently needed to learn more about differences between the sexes, individuals, and populations and the impact of diet and energy metabolism on hormone metabolites.},

Although tri-axial accelerometers are increasingly employed for this purpose, their application in smallbodied animals has been limited by weight restrictions. Additionally, accelerometers engender novel complications, as a system is needed to reliably map acceleration to behaviors. In this study, we describe newly developed, tiny acceleration-logging devices (1.5\textendash 2.5 g) and use them to characterize behavior in two chipmunk species. We collected paired accelerometer readings and behavioral observations from captive individuals. We then employed techniques from machine learning to develop an automatic system for coding accelerometer readings into behavioral categories. Finally, we deployed and recovered accelerometers from free-living, wild chipmunks. This is the first time to our knowledge that accelerometers have been used to generate behavioral data for small-bodied ({$<$}100 g), free-living mammals.},

In Lingulodinium polyedrum a daily synthesis and destruction of proteins is used to regulate activity. Experiments indicate that the amino acids from the degradation are conserved and incorporated into the resynthesized protein in the subsequent cycle. A different species, Pyrocystis lunula, also exhibits a rhythm of bioluminescence, but the luciferase is not destroyed and resynthesized each cycle. This paper posits that synthesis and destruction constitutes a cellular mechanism to conserve nitrogen in an environment where the resource is limiting.},

We provide a tutorial for maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and model selection using information theoretics, including a brief treatment of procedures for model comparison, model averaging, and use of data from multiple sources. We discuss the advantages of likelihood estimation, Bayesian analysis, and meta-analysis as ways to accumulate understanding across multiple studies. These statistical methods hold promise for new insight in ecology by encouraging thoughtful model building as part of inquiry, providing a unified framework for the empirical analysis of theoretical models, and by facilitating the formal accumulation of evidence bearing on fundamental questions.},

  abstract = {The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is the principal component of the mammalian biological clock, the neural timing system that generates and coordinates a broad spectrum of physiological, endocrine and behavioural circadian rhythms. The pacemaker of the SCN oscillates with a near 24 h period and is entrained to the diurnal light\textendash dark cycle. Consistent with its role in circadian timing, investigations in rodents and non-human primates furthermore suggest that the SCN is the locus of the brain's endogenous calendar, enabling organisms to anticipate seasonal environmental changes. The present review focuses on the neuronal organization and dynamic properties of the biological clock and the means by which it is synchronized with the environmental lighting conditions. It is shown that the functional activity of the biological clock is entrained to the seasonal photic cycle and that photoperiod (day length) may act as an effective zeitgeber. Furthermore, new insights are presented, based on electrophysiological and molecular studies, that the mammalian circadian timing system consists of coupled oscillators and that the clock genes of these oscillators may also function as calendar genes. In summary, there are now strong indications that the neuronal changes and adaptations in mammals that occur in response to a seasonally changing environment are driven by an endogenous circadian clock located in the SCN, and that this neural calendar is reset by the seasonal fluctuations in photoperiod.},

  abstract = {G. Evelyn Hutchinson more than a half century ago proposed that one could characterize the ecological niche of a species as an abstract mapping of population dynamics onto an environmental space, the axes of which are abiotic and biotic factors that influence birth and death rates. If a habitat has conditions within a species' niche, a population should persist without immigration from external sources, whereas if conditions are outside the niche, it faces extinction. Analyses of species' niches are essential to understanding controls on species' geographical range limits and how these limits might shift in our rapidly changing world. Recent developments in ecology and evolutionary biology suggest it is time to revisit and refine Hutchinson's niche concept. After reviewing techniques for quantifying niches, I examine subtleties that arise because of impacts species have on their own environments, the density-dependent modulation of how individuals experience environments, and the interplay of dispersal and temporal heterogeneity in determining population persistence. Moreover, the evolutionary record over all time scales reveals a spectrum of rates of change in species' niches, from rapid niche evolution to profound niche conservatism. Substantial challenges revolving around the evolutionary dimension of the Hutchinsonian niche include quantifying the magnitude of evolved intraspecific and clade-level variation in niches and understanding the factors that govern where along the spectrum of potential evolutionary rates any given lineage lies. A growing body of theory provides elements of a conceptual framework for understanding niche conservatism and evolution, paving the way for an evolutionary theory of the niche.},

  abstract = {The SCN of the hypothalamus contains a major pacemaker, which exhibits 24-h rhythms in electrical impulse frequency. Although it is known that SCN electrical activity is high during the day and low during the night, the precise relationship between electrical activity and behavioral rhythms is almost entirely unknown. The authors performed long-term recordings of SCN multiple unit activity with the aid of implanted microelectrodes in parallel with the drinking activity in freely moving mice. The animals were kept in a 12h:12h light-dark cycle (LD 12:12) and in short-day (LD 8:16) and long-day photoperiods (LD 16:8). Onsets and offsets of behavioral activity occurred when SCN discharge was around half-maximum value. Of the onsets 80\%, and of the offsets 62\%, occurred when SCN electrical activity differed less than 15\% from the half-maximum electrical activity levels. Transitions between rest and activity could be described by a sigmoid shaped probability curve with Hill coefficients of 7.0 for onsets and 5.7 for offsets. The similarity in the onset and offset levels shows an absence of hysteresis in the control of behavioral activity by the SCN. Exposure to short- or long-day photoperiods induced significant alterations in the waveform of electrical activity but did not affect SCN electrical activity levels at which behavioral transitions occurred. In all photoperiods, the SCN signal was skewed with more rapid discharge changes during onsets (19\% per hour) than offsets (11\% per hour). The precision of the circadian system appears optimized, as transitions between behavioral activity and rest occur when the change in SCN electrical activity is maximal, both during the declining and rising phase. The authors conclude that transitions in behavioral state can be described by a probability function around half-maximum electrical activity levels and that the parameters of the SCN, predicting onset and offset of behavior, are remarkably insensitive to environmental conditions.},

The animals emerged on average 4.02 h (SD = 0.45) after civil twilight at dawn and retreated in their burrows on average 2.87 h (SD = 0.47) before civil twilight at dusk. Daily patterns of light perceived by these burrowing mammals were measured with light-sensitive radio collar transmitters in an enclosure (the Netherlands) and in the field (Hungary). The observational data are corroborated by the telemetry data, which show clear daily patterns of timing of light perception including light perceived from the burrow entrances. The first light was observed by the animals on average 3.54 h (enclosure, SD = 0.45) and 3.60 h (field, SD = 0.31) after civil twilight at dawn, whereas the final observed light was on average 3.04 h (enclosure, SD = 0.64) and 2.02 h (field, SD = 0.72) before civil twilight at dusk. Thus, the animals do not perceive the rapid natural light-dark (LD) transitions that occur at civil twilight. Instead, they generate their own pattern of exposure to light within the natural LD cycle. The classical phase response model for entrainment by light or dark pulses cannot explain how the circadian system of this species remains entrained to the external, natural LD cycle while the major LD transitions are created by its own behavior.},

The daily environmental cycles of light and temperature are a dominant ecological factor generating a variety of adaptations among animals. In this review, we describe these adaptations with a special focus on the visual system and on the adaptive plasticity of activity patterns. Our goals are: (1) Underscore the importance of the 24-h time axis as critical variable in the ecological niche. (2) Highlight cases of temporal niche switches at the evolutionary timescale (phylogenetic level). (3) Review temporal niche switching within an individual's lifespan. (4) Evaluate possible underlying mechanisms for temporal niche switching. (5) Describe a new hypothesis of circadian thermoenergetics which may explain several cases of temporal niche switching in mammals. With this, we hope to inspire experiments under natural conditions or more complex laboratory environments, aimed to reveal environmental factors and mechanisms underlying specific temporal programs.},

  abstract = {Nocturnal rodents show diurnal food anticipatory activity when food access is restricted to a few hours in daytime. Timed food access also results in reduced food intake, but the role of food intake in circadian organization per se has not been described. By simulating natural food shortage in mice that work for food we show that reduced food intake alone shifts the activity phase from the night into the day and eventually causes nocturnal torpor (natural hypothermia). Release into continuous darkness with ad libitum food, elicits immediate reversal of activity to the previous nocturnal phase, indicating that the classical circadian pacemaker maintained its phase to the light-dark cycle. This flexibility in behavioral timing would allow mice to exploit the diurnal temporal niche while minimizing energy expenditure under poor feeding conditions in nature. This study reveals an intimate link between metabolism and mammalian circadian organization.},

We assessed rat testis histopathology and androgen function following two weeks exposure to either glyphosate at 2.5 and 25 mg/kg bw/day (5x and 50x Acceptable Daily Intake, ADI, respectively), or equivalent high dose of glyphosate in a herbicide formulation; Glyfonova. We observed no significant effects on testes or testosterone synthesis in rats exposed to glyphosate. Limited effects were observed in rats exposed to Glyfonova, with a small upregulation of the steroidogenic genes Cyp11a1 and Cyp17a1. We conclude that glyphosate alone has no effect on adult rat testis at exposure levels up to 25 mg/kg bw/day. Glyfonova induced only minor effects on steroidogenic gene expression, likely caused by additives other than glyphosate.},

Although red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are generally well studied, differences in their activity patterns related to seasonality and anthropogenic impacts remain not well known. Hunting is a major anthropogenic influence on fox populations across the globe. In this paper, we assess how circadian activity patterns of red foxes in a central European montane forest change throughout the year and test whether activity patterns differ between areas with different culling regimes. We found pronounced activity peaks around dawn and particularly dusk and high levels of activity throughout the night. Foxes generally avoided daylight hours, except in wintertime, potentially indicating an avoidance of human presence. The onset and cessation of activity tracked changes in day length. Circadian activity patterns were highly similar at sites with and without targeted culls during all seasons, not suggesting a direct reaction of red foxes to hunting. Red fox activity patterns in our study were thus overall comparable with those in other environmental contexts.},

Previously, we proposed a molecular timetable based on circadian-oscillating substances in multiple mouse organs or blood to estimate internal body time from samples taken at only a few time points. Here we applied this molecular-timetable concept to estimate and evaluate internal body time in humans. We constructed a 1.5-d reference timetable of oscillating metabolites in human blood samples with 2-h sampling frequency while simultaneously controlling for the confounding effects of activity level, light, temperature, sleep, and food intake. By using this metabolite timetable as a reference, we accurately determined internal body time within 3 h from just two anti-phase blood samples. Our minimally invasive, molecular-timetable method with human blood enables highly optimized and personalized medicine.},

For each data-logger record, we extracted 5\,s of data when any of the three-axis accelerations exceeded absolute 2.0\,g, to capture all feeding behaviours and other burst behaviours. Each feeding behaviour was then identified using a combination of parameters that were derived from the extracted data. Using decision trees with the parameters, high true identification rates (87.5\% for both feeding behaviours) with low false identification rates (5\% for crab-eating and 6.3\% for fisheating) were achieved for both feeding behaviours.},

  abstract = {For 3 yr we studied the reproductive responses of desert rodents in the Owens Valley of eastern California (average annual precipitation 14 cm): four nocturnal heteromyids-the kangaroo rats Dipodomys microps and D. merriami and the pocket mice Perognathus formosus and P. longimembris-and one diurnal sciurid, the antelope ground squirrel, Ammospermophilus leucurus. Reproductive status was assessed by autopsies of adults trapped at approximately monthly intervals. Reproduction differed conspicuously among the five species. Our analysis illustrates effects of body size, phylogenetic association, and adaptation to the desert environment upon reproductive performances and associated life-history parameters. Most breeding occurs in late winter and early spring. Winter rains cause a series of pulses in vegetation growth and an attendant increase in availability of water in food plants, which contribute to rodent reproduction. Among the four heteromyids, onset of breeding is sequential according to body size, with the largest first. Pocket mice hibernate (P. formosus typically 31/2 mo, P. longimembris 6'/2 mo), which restricts their breeding season compared to that of Dipodomys, but breeding normally begins following hibernation. The males of all species precede females in reproductive readiness; sperm production begins 11/2 to 2 mo before mating begins. Some male D. merriami remain spermatogenic throughout the year, and the mating season of this species is the longest (typically 2'/2 mo) and most variable of any of the species. D. merriami typically produces only two young, which are weaned in just less than 3 wk. It can breed repeatedly under favorable conditions and is the only species in which we observed reproductive maturity of both male and female juveniles in the season of birth. D. merriami has the highest annual reproductive potential of any of the five species studied. D. microps, although larger than D. merriami and sharing similar traits of small litter size and rapid growth, has a more restricted mating season (typically 1'/2 mo), but its breeding success generally exceeds that of D. merriami. The diet of saltbush leaves consumed by D. microps is atypical within this generally granivorous rodent family. Saltbush is a perennial shrub with highly predictable spring growth of leaves that are used by lactating mothers and developing young. Consequently the breeding season of D. microps is less variable and shorter than that of D. merriami. D. microps typically produces one litter per year and the juveniles typically do not mature sexually in the season of their birth.},

Peromyscus maniculatus (deer mouse) did not hibernate. The three sciur only once a year, with a 1- to 2-week mating period between late March and early amoenus bred about a month before the other two sciurids. Males emerged from hibern 2 weeks before females, and mating occurred within a week of female emergence. P. man began breeding in February and continued through October; adult females produced as m three litters, and the earliest juvenile cohorts reproduced in the year of birth. None of the became reproductively active until they were yearlings, and some E. townsendii and S. s did not breed until 2 years of age. Average litter size was similar in the four species: S. satu 4.1; E. townsendii, 3.8; E. amoenus, 5.0; and P. maniculatus, 4.6. Because female P. manic bear 2-3 litters per year and juveniles breed in the year of birth, this species has the most timing and greatest annual reproductive potential. The total mass of young produced at of gestation and upon emergence from the natal burrow imposes an energetic burden th inversely with body mass among the four species. Lipid reserves do not contribute dir energy requirements of gestation and lactation. Lipid reserves play a major sustaining rol hibernation in S. saturatus (prehibernation body fat {$>$}30\%), but chipmunks fatten only s (body fat {$<$} 7\%) and rely on food caches during hibernation.

Original functions associated with the melanopsin system include the photoentrainment of circadian sleep-wake cycles and the pupillary light reflex. Recent findings, however, suggest a much broader involvement of this system in an array of physiologic responses to light. This newfound insight into the underlying function of the non\textendash image-forming system has revealed the many connections to human pathology and attendant disease states, including seasonal affective disorder, migraine, glaucoma, inherited mitochondrial optic neuropathy, and sleep dysregulation of aging. In this review, the authors discuss in detail the clinical implications of the melanopsin system.},

The aim of the current study is threefold. First, we assess the prevalence of mental health problems in a representative sample of PhD students in Flanders, Belgium (N = 3659). Second, we compare PhD students to three other samples: (1) highly educated in the general population (N = 769); (2) highly educated employees (N = 592); and (3) higher education students (N = 333). Third, we assess those organizational factors relating to the role of PhD students that predict mental health status. Results based on 12 mental health symptoms (GHQ-12) showed that 32\% of PhD students are at risk of having or developing a common psychiatric disorder, especially depression. This estimate was significantly higher than those obtained in the comparison groups. Organizational policies were significantly associated with the prevalence of mental health problems. Especially workfamily interface, job demands and job control, the supervisor's leadership style, team decision-making culture, and perception of a career outside academia are linked to mental health problems.},

  abstract = {Examples of animals that switch activity times between nocturnality and diurnality in nature are relatively infrequent. Furthermore, the mechanism for switching activity time is not clear: does a complete inversion of the circadian system occur in conjunction with activity pattern? Are there switching centers downstream from the internal clock that interpret the clock differently? Or does the switch reflect a masking effect? Answering these key questions may shed light on the mechanisms regulating activity patterns and their evolution. The golden spiny mouse (Acomys russatus) can switch between nocturnal and diurnal activity. This study investigated the relationship between its internal circadian clock and its diurnal activity pattern observed in the field. The goal is to understand the mechanisms underlying species rhythm shifts in order to gain insight into the evolution of activity patterns. All golden spiny mice had opposite activity patterns in the field than those under controlled continuous dark conditions in the laboratory. Activity and body temperature patterns in the field were diurnal, while in the laboratory all individuals immediately showed a free-running rhythm starting with a nocturnal pattern. No phase transients were found toward the preferred nocturnal activity pattern, as would be expected in the case of true entrainment. Moreover, the fact that the free-running activity patterns began from the individuals' subjective night suggests that golden spiny mice are nocturnal and that their diurnality in their natural habitat in the field results from a change that is downstream to the internal clock or reflects a masking effect.},

On the other hand, the ability of species to shift their activity times during the diel cycle, and consequently to alter the environment in which activity occurs, has been largely neglected. Daily activity patterns are perceived as fairly fixed; however, natural changes in activity patterns have been reported in increasing numbers of species. Here, we present a framework that explores how shifts in activity patterns may buffer impacts of climate change. To demonstrate our framework, we simulated costs of activity of diurnal and nocturnal rodents and showed that future summers may decrease the energetic demands of nocturnal mammals while increasing water demands of diurnal mammals. Climate projections suggest that vegetation cover and water availability will decrease under future climate scenarios, especially in areas where water demands are expected to increase the most. These changes are expected to limit the ability of diurnal animals to restrict activity to shaded microhabitats and to keep a positive water balance. Our analysis shows that by shifting to nocturnality, diurnal mammals may mitigate the high water costs of future summers. We suggest that future research should explore the role of the diel time axis as an ecological resource when predicting the impacts of climate change.},

The effect of staged encounters on androgen depended on time of year. In spring, androgen levels significantly increased after staged encounters, except during the peak of mating activity when levels were maximal in all reproductive males. In late summer, staged encounters had no significant effect on androgen levels. In spring but not summer, androgen was positively correlated to the relative intensity of encounters. These results suggest that circulating levels of androgen in male arctic ground squirrels result from a combination of seasonal and social factors. Responsiveness of androgen to encounters during spring but not late summer support the challenge hypothesis for this polygynous mammal.},

Over time, many of these techniques have become part of the conservation physiology toolbox, which is used to monitor, predict, conserve, and restore plant and animal populations under threat. Here, we provide a summary of the tools that currently comprise the conservation physiology toolbox. By assessing patterns in articles that have been published in `Conservation Physiology' over the past 5 years that focus on introducing, refining and validating tools, we provide an overview of where researchers are placing emphasis in terms of taxa and physiological sub-disciplines. Although there is certainly diversity across the toolbox, metrics of stress physiology (particularly glucocorticoids) and studies focusing on mammals have garnered the greatest attention, with both comprising the majority of publications ({$>$}45\%). We also summarize the types of validations that are actively being completed, including those related to logistics (sample collection, storage and processing), interpretation of variation in physiological traits and relevance for conservation science. Finally, we provide recommendations for future tool refinement, with suggestions for: (i) improving our understanding of the applicability of glucocorticoid physiology; (ii) linking multiple physiological and non-physiological tools; (iii) establishing a framework for plant conservation physiology; (iv) assessing links between environmental disturbance, physiology and fitness; (v) appreciating opportunities for validations in underrepresented taxa; and (vi) emphasizing tool validation as a core component of research programmes. Overall, we are confident that conservation physiology will continue to increase its applicability to more taxa, develop more non-invasive techniques, delineate where limitations exist, and identify the contexts necessary for interpretation in captivity and the wild.},

Population size was consistently low throughout the study and was related to the low habitat productivity. Mortality rates were low, although for juveniles the estimations were higher than for adults. Individuals have an average life expectancy of 22-25 months, but some individuals lived at least three years. Reproductive activity started by July and ended by March, when last known pregnancies were recorded. This long reproductive season allowed a gradual incorporation of young over an extended period of time, with a restricted period of recruitment lacking. Sex ratio did not depart from 1:1 and appears to be density dependent. The spatial distribution of individuals was clumped and corresponded to the patchy distribution of suitable habitats. The results are compared and contrasted with those from previous demographic studies performed in other conspecifics as well as in other subterranean rodents.},

  abstract = {Background Sleep is an inactive state of reduced environmental awareness shared by all animals. When compared to wakefulness, sleep behavior is associated with changes in physiology and brain activity. The nature of these changes varies considerably across species, and therefore is a rich resource for gaining insight into the evolution and functions of sleep. A major obstacle to capitalizing on this resource is the lack of a small device capable of recording multiple biological parameters for extended periods of time both in the laboratory and the field. New method ONEIROS is a new tool designed for conducting sleep research on small, freely moving animals. The miniature, standalone system is capable of recording up to 26 electrophysiological signals (electroencephalogram, electromyogram, electrooculogram, electrocardiogram), metabolic (3 temperature channels) and behavior via an accelerometer for several days. In addition, the device is equipped with a vibrating motor which can be used to assess arousal thresholds and to disrupt sleep. The system is available in telemetric or data-logger configuration useable in the field. Results To demonstrate the efficacy of this tool, we simultaneously recorded for the first time, electroencephalogram, hippocampal local field potential, electromyogram, electrooculogram, brain, body and ambient temperature, and 3D accelerometry. We also deprived rats of paradoxical sleep by triggering the vibrating motor after online recognition of the state. Finally, by successfully recording a pigeon in an 8\,m3 aviary in a social context with the device in the logger configuration, we demonstrate the feasibility of using the device in the field.},

  abstract = {Fecal hormone assays provide a powerful tool for noninvasive monitoring of endocrine status in wild animals. In this study we validated a protocol for extracting and measuring glucocorticoids in freeliving and captive Belding's ground squirrels (Spermophilus beldingi). We first compared two commonly used extraction protocols to determine which performed better with commercially available antibodies. We next verified the preferred extraction method by correlating circulating and fecal glucocorticoid measures from a group of individuals over time. For this comparison, we used both a cortisol and a corticosterone antibody to determine which had greater affinity to the fecal metabolites. Cortisol was the primary circulating glucocorticoid, but both hormones were present in well above detectable concentrations in the blood, which does not occur in other sciurids. In addition, the cortisol antibody showed greater binding with the fecal extracts than did the corticosterone antibody. Finally, we used adrenocorticotropic hormone and dexamethasone challenges to demonstrate that changes in adrenal functioning are reflected in changing fecal corticoid levels. These results suggest that our extraction protocol provides a fast, reliable assay of stress hormones in freeliving ground squirrels without the confounding influence of short-term rises in glucocorticoid concentrations caused by handling and restraint stress and that it can facilitate ecological and evolutionary studies of stress in wild species.},

  abstract = {Ecological systems can often be characterised by changes among a finite set of underlying states pertaining to individuals, populations, communities or entire ecosystems through time. Owing to the inherent difficulty of empirical field studies, ecological state dynamics operating at any level of this hierarchy can often be unobservable or `hidden'. Ecologists must therefore often contend with incomplete or indirect observations that are somehow related to these underlying processes. By formally disentangling state and observation processes based on simple yet powerful mathematical properties that can be used to describe many ecological phenomena, hidden Markov models (HMMs) can facilitate inferences about complex system state dynamics that might otherwise be intractable. However, HMMs have only recently begun to gain traction within the broader ecological community. We provide a gentle introduction to HMMs, establish some common terminology, review the immense scope of HMMs for applied ecological research and provide a tutorial on implementation and interpretation. By illustrating how practitioners can use a simple conceptual template to customise HMMs for their specific systems of interest, revealing methodological links between existing applications, and highlighting some practical considerations and limitations of these approaches, our goal is to help establish HMMs as a fundamental inferential tool for ecologists.},

  abstract = {A rapid means of assessing reproductive status in rodents is useful not only in the study of reproductive dysfunction but is also required for the production of new mouse models of disease and investigations into the hormonal regulation of tissue degeneration (or regeneration) following pathological challenge. The murine reproductive (or estrous) cycle is divided into 4 stages: proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus. Defined fluctuations in circulating levels of the ovarian steroids 17-{$\beta$}-estradiol and progesterone, the gonadotropins luteinizing and follicle stimulating hormones, and the luteotropic hormone prolactin signal transition through these reproductive stages. Changes in cell typology within the murine vaginal canal reflect these underlying endocrine events. Daily assessment of the relative ratio of nucleated epithelial cells, cornified squamous epithelial cells, and leukocytes present in vaginal smears can be used to identify murine estrous stages. The degree of invasiveness, however, employed in collecting these samples can alter reproductive status and elicit an inflammatory response that can confound cytological assessment of smears. Here, we describe a simple, non-invasive protocol that can be used to determine the stage of the estrous cycle of a female mouse without altering her reproductive cycle. We detail how to differentiate between the four stages of the estrous cycle by collection and analysis of predominant cell typology in vaginal smears and we show how these changes can be interpreted with respect to endocrine status.},

  abstract = {Circadian organization means the way in which the entire circadian system above the cellular level is put together physically and the principles and rules that determine the interactions among its component parts which produce overt rhythms of physiology and behavior. Understanding this organization and its evolution is of practical importance as well as of basic interest. The first major problem that we face is the difficulty of making sense of the apparently great diversity that we observe in circadian organization of diverse vertebrates. Some of this diversity falls neatly into place along phylogenetic lines leading to firm generalizations: i) in all vertebrates there is a ``circadian axis'' consisting of the retinas, the pineal gland and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), ii) in many non-mammalian vertebrates of all classes (but not in any mammals) the pineal gland is both a photoreceptor and a circadian oscillator, and iii) in all non-mammalian vertebrates (but not in any mammals) there are extraretinal (and extrapineal) circadian photoreceptors. An interesting explanation of some of these facts, especially the differences between mammals and other vertebrates, can be constructed on the assumption that early in their evolution mammals passed through a ``nocturnal bottleneck''. On the other hand, a good deal of the diversity among the circadian systems of vertebrates does not fall neatly into place along phylogenetic lines. In the present review we will consider how we might better understand such ``phylogenetically incoherent'' diversity and what sorts of new information may help to further our understanding of the evolution of circadian organization in vertebrates.},

Most risk avoidance behaviors, such as temporal avoidance, have severe trade-offs between foraging efficiency and risk reduction. Human activities are able to affect the species landscape of fear, by increasing mortality of individuals (i.e. hunting, roadkill) and by disruption of the clues used by the species to estimate predation risk (e.g. light pollution). In this study, we used an extensive camera-trapping and night-time light satellite imagery to evaluate whether human activities affect the diel activity patterns of 17 species of rainforest dwelling mammals. We found evidence of diel activity shifts in eight of 17 analyzed species, in which five species become 21.6 \% more nocturnal and three species become 11.7\% more diurnal in high disturbed areas. This activity shifts were observed for both diurnal and nocturnal species. Persecuted species (game and predators) were more susceptible to present activity shifts. Since changes in foraging activity may affect species fitness, the behavior of humans' avoidance may be another driver of the Anthropocene defaunation.},

  abstract = {Environmental variability in aquatic ecosystems makes the study of ectotherms complex and challenging. Physiologists have historically overcome this hurdle in the laboratory by using `average' conditions, representative of the natural environment for any given animal. Temperature, in particular, has widespread impact on the physiology of animals, and it is becoming increasingly important to understand these effects as we face future climate challenges. The majority of research to date has focused on the expected global average increase in temperature; however, increases in climate variability are predicted to affect animals as much or more than climate warming. Physiological responses associated with the acclimation to a new stable temperature are distinct from those in thermally variable environments. Our goal is to highlight these physiological differences as they relate to both thermal acclimation and the `fallacy of the average' or Jensen's inequality using theoretical models and novel empirical data. We encourage the use of more realistic thermal environments in experimental design to advance our understanding of these physiological responses such that we can better predict how aquatic animals will respond to future changes in our climate.},

Our analysis suggests that the Enright method is the most accurate for estimating the period of oscillatory data. We further show that to accurately estimate the period of oscillatory data, it is necessary that at least five cycles of data are sampled, using at least four data points per cycle.

  abstract = {Summary Good conditions for migration may promote offshore flights in nocturnal autumn migrants at the northern border of the Mediterranean Sea, whereas unfavourable conditions may induce flights along the coast. These predictions were tested by performing orientation cage experiments and making simultaneous observations of free-flying birds using a tracking radar. The flight directions of free-flying birds were mainly towards southwest and did not differ between overcast and clear sky conditions. The caged birds, however, tended towards southwest under clear sky and showed a more scattered distribution in the southwest and southeast quadrants under overcast conditions. Similar directional scatter occurred when the cage experiments were performed late at night. In contrast, free-flying birds shifted their flight direction towards west as night progressed to avoid flights across the sea. Flight directions observed by radar shifted slightly towards west as the season progressed owing to more frequent southeasterly winds. In orientation cages, however, directional preference was scattered towards southwest and southeast in the early migratory season and became unimodal (southwest) at the peak of the season; this change was not caused by different species composition. Consequently, there is a general coincidence of flight directions and directional preferences in orientation cages, but interpretations of results from orientation cages must allow for the possibility that experimental directions are different from migratory directions of free-flying birds, particularly under suboptimal migratory conditions.},

The proposition is developed that the left and right pacemakers in the two optic lobes are mutally coupled and that the compound pacemaker's period is shorter than either of its constituent pacemakers.

  abstract = {Background: Central place foragers (CPF) rest within a central place, and theory predicts that distance of patches from this central place sets the outer limits of the foraging arena. Many marine ectothermic predators behave like CPF animals, but never stop swimming, suggesting that predators will incur `travelling' costs while resting. Currently, it is unknown how these CPF predators behave or how modulation of behavior contributes to daily energy budgets. We combine acoustic telemetry, multi-sensor loggers, and hidden Markov models (HMMs) to generate `activity seascapes', which combine space use with patterns of activity, for reef sharks (blacktip reef and grey reef sharks) at an unfished Pacific atoll. Results: Sharks of both species occupied a central place during the day within deeper, cooler water where they were less active, and became more active over a larger area at night in shallower water. However, video cameras on two grey reef sharks revealed foraging attempts/success occurring throughout the day, and that multiple sharks were refuging in common areas. A simple bioenergetics model for grey reef sharks predicted that diel changes in energy expenditure are primarily driven by changes in swim speed and not body temperature. Conclusions: We provide a new method for simultaneously visualizing diel space use and behavior in marine predators, which does not require the simultaneous measure of both from each animal. We show that blacktip and grey reef sharks behave as CPFs, with diel changes in activity, horizontal and vertical space use. However, aspects of their foraging behavior may differ from other predictions of traditional CPF models. In particular, for species that never stop swimming, patch foraging times may be unrelated to patch travel distance.},

  abstract = {The behavior of many wild animals remains a mystery, as it is difficult to quantify behavior of species that cannot be easily followed throughout their daily or seasonal movements. Accelerometers can solve some of these mysteries, as they collect activity data at a high temporal resolution ({$<$}1 s), can be relatively small ({$<$}1 g) so they minimally disrupt behavior, and are increasingly capable of recording data for long periods. Nonetheless, there is a need for increased validation of methods to classify animal behavior from accelerometers to promote widespread adoption of this technology in ecology. We assessed the accuracy of six different behavioral assignment methods for two species of seabird, thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia) and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla). We identified three behaviors using tri-axial accelerometers: standing, swimming, and flying, after classifying diving using a pressure sensor for murres. We evaluated six classification methods relative to independent classifications from concurrent GPS tracking data. We used four variables for classification: depth, wing beat frequency, pitch, and dynamic acceleration. Average accuracy for all methods was {$>$}98\% for murres, and 89\% and 93\% for kittiwakes during incubation and chick rearing, respectively. Variable selection showed that classification accuracy did not improve with more than two (kittiwakes) or three (murres) variables. We conclude that simple methods of behavioral classification can be as accurate for classifying basic behaviors as more complex approaches, and that identifying suitable accelerometer metrics is more important than using a particular classification method when the objective is to develop a daily activity or energy budget. Highly accurate daily activity budgets can be generated from accelerometer data using multiple methods and a small number of accelerometer metrics; therefore, identifying a suitable behavioral classification method should not be a barrier to using accelerometers in studies of seabird behavior and ecology.},

Animals were subjected to one of several increasingly greater work requirements by using a caging system in which a food-pellet dispenser was controlled by wheel-running activity. Locomotor behaviour, food consumption and body weights were assessed continuously during pre-reproduction, pregnancy and lactation. Peromyscus and Mus differed in the magnitude and temporal dimensions of their locomotor effort; however, both species often ran far more wheel revolutions than necessary to generate the number of food pellets eaten, except during lactation when females invested all of their wheel-running into obtaining food. Peromyscus maintained greater body weights, supported greater litter masses, and produced more pups at weaning than their Mus counterparts, but Peromyscus also required less food per unit of mass than Mus. Most Peromyscus females maintained at the highest work levels did not attempt reproduction. Among Peromyscus that did become pregnant, litter size at birth and at weaning averaged five or six pups, regardless of feeding conditions. Peromyscus pups became increasingly stunted as females worked harder but obtained less food. Mus females allowed insemination and attempted lactation regardless of feeding conditions, but they routinely cannibalized offspring throughout the first 12 days of lactation. Thus, as litter size was reduced, most surviving Mus pups attained similar body weights at weaning. There was no evidence of sex-ratio adjustments in either species. In conclusion, Peromyseus females exhibited a rigid 'all-or-nothing' reproductive response, typically increasing their feeding effort to support large litters, whereas Mus females eliminated pups to stabilize the energy burdens of lactation. The divergent energy-allocation strategies employed by female Peromyscus and Mus appear correlated with their respective tendencies for seasonally oriented versus opportunistic breeding in the wild.},

  abstract = {Abstract               The relationship between food energy and work effort (foraging) is crucial to small mammals such as the house mouse (Mus domesticus). Energy allocation processes were studied by using a special caging system in which animals were required to work for 45 mg food pellets by running on an activity wheel. Two experimental themes were investigated: 1) When weaning female mice were forced to work harder for less food, their highest energy allocation priority was to maintain fat reserves; body growth was next in importance while achieving puberty had the lowest prority of all. The relative insensitivity of fat deposition to high foraging costs suggests a strategy for survival whereby dispersing animals maintain emergency fat reserves at the expense of growth and fertility. In male mice, however, reproductive development is independent from body growth. Both sexes employed fundamentally different energy allocation strategies during peripubertal development. Some of these sex differences were gonad-dependent, while others were not. The time spent foraging while exposed to cold ambient temperature is also critical during peripubertal development, and this relationship probably determines whether or not house mice will breed continuously or seasonally in feral habitats. 2) Deer mice (Pemmyscus maniculatus) and house mice were challenged to produce litters at increasingly greater work requirements. Deer mice supported heavier litters and produced more pups at weaning than house mice, mainly because deer mice were more efficient at food use. With regard to circadian organisation, deer mice accomplished almost all of their locomotor tasks during darkness while house mice exhibited day-to-day flexibility in locomotor activity, especially during lactation. Deer mice attempted to wean five or six pups, regardless of how severe the feeding conditions; however, pups became progressively stunted as females worked harder and obtained less food. In contrast, house mice had more pups at birth than deer mice, but females killed and cannibalized offspring throughout the first 12 days of lactation. Most surviving house mouse pups thus attained similar body weights at weaning. These divergent energy allocation patterns may reflect strategies arising from opportunism (house mice) versus seasonality (deer mice).},

Peripubertal animals of both sexes, either intact or gonadectomized, were subjected for 8 weeks to one of two feeding requirements by using a caging system in which a pellet dispenser was controlled by activity on a running wheel. Recently weaned animals were required to run 200 vs 300 or more wheel revolutions to obtain a pellet of food. The 200 revolution requirement allowed normal body growth and reproductive development; the 300+ requirement was adjusted weekly to maintain food intake at a level that allowed survival but did not permit normal body growth. Reproductive development was completely inhibited in intact females at 300 + revolutions whereas intact males at 300 + revolutions, despite stunted growth, all experienced normal sexual development. At both feeding requirements, however, females exhibited more total locomotor activity and consumed more food than males, regardless of gonadectomy. Furthermore, at the 200 revolution requirement we often observed extensive running activity beyond that needed to generate the amount of food actually eaten, especially among females. This "extra" locomotor activity was gonad-dependent in males, but not so in females. These results suggest that male and female house mice employ different strategies when relating their behavior and reproductive development to existing foraging conditions. Females appear more resource-dependent than males.},

  abstract = {Orientation of physiology and behavior in time is a major adaptation common to many organisms and represents a significant challenge. In the face of predictable seasonal changes in climatic factors, and as a result of natural selection, many mammals now restrict their reproductive efforts to the fraction of the year when conditions of temperature, food, and water are most favorable for successful weaning of offspring. Changes in day length figure prominently in the synchronization of mammalian seasonal reproductive cycles. In summer breeders (e.g., several hamster, vole, and mouse species), decreasing summer day lengths induce reproductive involution. During this interval, neuroendocrine mechanisms analogous to a simple reference memory permit discrimination of stimulatory from inhibitory photoperiods. The non-reproductive phenotype is sustained for several months thereafter by the inhibitory short days of late summer, autumn, and early winter. Mid-winter reactivation of the reproductive system is triggered after 20 \textendash{} 25 weeks of exposure to decreasing or short days by an interval timer that renders the reproductive neuroendocrine system refractory to short days. Recent work that has explored formal and physiological properties of this photorefractoriness interval timer has identified sex differences, neural substrates, and changes in hypothalamic gene expression that may participate in the measurement of seasonal time.},

The vector of the dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA) may be a better proxy so this study compared ODBA and VeDBA as proxies for rate of oxygen consumption using humans and 6 other species. Twenty-one humans on a treadmill ran at different speeds while equipped with two loggers, one in a straight orientation and the other skewed, while rate of oxygen consumption () was recorded. Similar data were obtained from animals but using only one (straight) logger. In humans, both ODBA and VeDBA were good proxies for with all r2 values exceeding 0.88, although ODBA accounted for slightly but significantly more of the variation in than did VeDBA (P{$<$}0.03). There were no significant differences between ODBA and VeDBA in terms of the change in estimated by the acceleration data in a simulated situation of the logger being mounted straight but then becoming skewed (P = 0.744). In the animal study, ODBA and VeDBA were again good proxies for with all r2 values exceeding 0.70 although, again, ODBA accounted for slightly, but significantly, more of the variation in than did VeDBA (P{$<$}0.03). The simultaneous contraction of muscles, inserted variously for limb stability, may produce muscle oxygen use that at least partially equates with summing components to derive DBA. Thus, a vectorial summation to derive DBA cannot be assumed to be the more `correct' calculation. However, although within the limitations of our simple study, ODBA appears a marginally better proxy for . In the unusual situation where researchers are unable to guarantee at least reasonably consistent device orientation, they should use VeDBA as a proxy for .},

  abstract = {The functions of sleep remain an unresolved question in biology. One approach to revealing sleep's purpose is to identify traits that explain why some species sleep more than others. Recent comparative studies of sleep have identified relationships between various physiological, neuroanatomical and ecological traits, and the time mammals spend in rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep. However, owing to technological constraints, these studies were based exclusively on animals in captivity. Consequently, it is unclear to what extent the unnatural laboratory environment affected time spent sleeping, and thereby the identification and interpretation of informative clues to the functions of sleep. We performed the first electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of sleep on unrestricted animals in the wild using a recently developed miniaturized EEG recorder, and found that brown-throated three-toed sloths (Bradypus variegatus) inhabiting the canopy of a tropical rainforest only sleep 9.63 h d(-1), over 6 h less than previously reported in captivity. Although the influence of factors such as the age of the animals studied cannot be ruled out, our results suggest that sleep in the wild may be markedly different from that in captivity. Additional studies of various species are thus needed to determine whether the relationships between sleep duration and various traits identified in captivity are fundamentally different in the wild. Our initial study of sloths demonstrates the feasibility of this endeavour, and thereby opens the door to comparative studies of sleep occurring within the ecological context within which it evolved.},

  abstract = {It is known that day-active Nile grass rats, Arvicanthis niloticus, increase the amount of activity in the night relative to that in the day when provided with running wheels. This was confirmed in the present study. Animals without a wheel displayed 69.0\% of their general activity in the L phase of a 12:12 h lightdark cycle; animals provided with wheels had only 48.6\% of their wheel revolutions in the light. The contribution of direct (masking) responses to light to the increased nocturnality of animals with wheels was examined in two experiments. In experiment 1, masking was tested by exposing the animals to repeated cycles of 30 min of entraining light and 30 min of a different, usually dimmer light, during the L phase of a 12:12 h light-dark cycle. For animals with wheels, there was more running during the 30-min pulses of dim light or darkness than during the 30-min periods of entraining light. In contrast, for animals without wheels, there was more general activity during the 30-min periods of entraining light than during the 30-min pulses of dim light or darkness. In experiment 2, the animals were first exposed to a 12:12 h light-dark cycle and then put on a 1:10:1:12 h LDLD skeleton photoperiod. Animals with wheels increased their running during the subjective day of the skeleton photoperiod compared to that in the actual day of the 12:12 h light-dark cycle. Animals without wheels showed similar levels of general activity during the subjective day of the skeleton photoperiod and the actual day of the 12:12 h cycle. These experiments demonstrate that when Nile rats have running wheels, their increased nocturnal activity is associated with an increased suppression of locomotion in direct response to light. It is possible that changes in masking responses to light may be an essential and integral component of switching between diurnal and nocturnal activity profiles.},

  abstract = {The theory of r- and K-selection was one of the first predictive models for life-history evolution. It helped to galvanize the empirical field of comparative life-history and dominated thinking on the subject from the late 1960s through the 1970s. Large quantities of field data were collected that claimed to test predictions of the theory. By the early 1980s, sentiment about the theory had changed so completely that a proposal to test it or the use of it to interpret empirical results would likely be viewed as archaic and na\"ive. The theory was displaced by demographic models that concentrated on mortality patterns as the cause of life-history evolution. Although demographic models are known for their density-independent approach and focus on extrinsic mortality, these models can incorporate many ecological features captured by r- and K-selection, such as density-dependent population regulation, resource availability, and environmental fluctuations. We highlight the incorporation of these factors in recent theory, then show how they are manifest in our research on life-history evolution in Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Explanations of the repeatable suites of life-history differences across populations of guppies originate from demographic models of predator-driven age-specific mortality. Recently, careful examination of guppy demography and habitat has revealed that density-dependent regulation and resource availability may have influenced the evolution of guppy life histories. In the field, these factors covary with predation risk; however, they can be uncoupled experimentally, providing insight into how they may have synergistically driven guppy life-history evolution. Although life-history theory has shifted away from a focus on r- and K-selection, the themes of density-dependent regulation, resource availability, and environmental fluctuations are integral to current demographic theory and are potentially important in any natural system.},

Here, we discuss the mechanisms underlying the circadian regulation of physiology and behavior in mammals. We also review recent efforts to understand circadian flexibility, such as how the phase of activity and rest is altered depending on the encountered environment. We explain why shifting activity to the day is an adaptive strategy to cope with energetic challenges and show how this can reduce thermoregulatory costs. A framework is provided to make predictions about the optimal timing of activity and rest of non-model species for a wide range of habitats. This Review illustrates how the timing of daily rhythms is reciprocally linked to energy homeostasis, and it highlights the importance of this link in understanding daily rhythms in physiology and behavior.},

  abstract = {Female bats of temperate zones often communally rear their young, which creates ideal conditions for naive juveniles to find or learn about resources via informed adults. However, studying social information transfer in elusive and small-bodied animals in the wild is difficult with traditional tracking techniques. We used a novel `next-generation' proximity sensor system (BATS) to investigate if and how juvenile bats use social information in acquiring access to two crucial resources: suitable roosts and food patches. By tracking juvenile\textendash adult associations during roost switching and foraging, we found evidence for mother-to-offspring information transfer while switching roosts but not during foraging. Spatial and temporal patterns of encounters suggested that mothers guided juveniles between the juvenile and the target roost. This roost-switching behaviour provides evidence for maternal guidance in bats, a form of maternal care that has long been assumed, but never documented. We did not find evidence that mothers guide the offspring to foraging sites. Foraging bats reported brief infrequent meetings with other tagged bats that were best explained by local enhancement. Our study illustrates how this recent advance in automated biologging provides researchers with new insights into longstanding questions in behavioural biology.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Recent advances in animal tracking technology have ushered in a new era in biologging. However, the considerable size of many sophisticated biologging devices restricts their application to larger animals, while old-fashioned techniques often still represent the state-of-the-art for studying small vertebrates. In industrial applications, low-power wireless sensor networks fulfill requirements similar to those needed to monitor animal behavior at high resolution and at low tag weight. We developed a wireless biologging network (WBN), which enables simultaneous direct proximity sensing, high-resolution tracking, and long-range remote data download at tag weights of one to two grams. Deployments to study wild bats created social networks and flight trajectories of unprecedented quality. Our developments highlight the vast capabilities of WBNs and their potential to close an important gap in biologging: fully automated tracking and proximity sensing of small animals, even in closed habitats, at high spatial and temporal resolution.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Shape and size of the aggregations depend on container type, light intensity, and cell density. In Petri dishes, cells form oval "swarms"; within these, cells move downward in the highly dense center and rise up at the periphery. We have investigated the daily rhythm of this swarming activity in Petri dishes illuminated from the side, using timelapse video recordings. At night, a "lawn" of cells forms at the bottom of the dish toward the light source (independent of light intensity). Before dawn, cells rise toward the surface and aggregate in swarms. The daily vertical migration occurs independent of light direction and intensity. The diurnal swarms, however, form every day at the same location within the dish, at a distance from the light that depends on light intensity, indicating a self-selection of light intensity. In constant light and temperature and with negligible vertical nutrient differences, all aspects of the rhythm continue to oscillate for up to 3 weeks, when the rhythm of the population becomes desynchronized.},

Rapid advances in technology are allowing scientists to use data-recording units to acquire huge, quantitative datasets of behavior from animals moving freely in their natural environment. In other words, scientists can examine wild animals in the field, behaving normally, with the same rigor that is normally used in the laboratory. The flexibility of such recording systems means that bio-logging science operates at the interface of several biological disciplines, looking at a wide array of aquatic, airborne, and terrestrial species, monitoring not only the physical characteristics of the environment, but also the animal's reactions to it. This approach is critically important in an era when global change threatens the survival of species and where habitat loss is leading to widespread extinctions.},

Individuals reached sexual maturity in the first reproductive season after their birth. Mature males were active all year long. Their testicular size increased in winter, when sexual activity of females began. Sexual ratio of immature and mature individuals was not significantly different from 1:1 throughout the year. The population consisted of a high proportion of mature individuals (73.7\%, n =141). This Piedmont population showed a longer reproductive period, and a higher percentage of pregnancy by postpartum estrus than a population from the Precordillera (3000 m elevation) previously studied. These characteristics would determine a higher reproductive potential, according to the better climatic conditions and higher food availability in the Piedmont.},

  abstract = {Activity level (the proportion of time that animals spend active) is a behavioural and ecological metric that can provide an indicator of energetics, foraging effort and exposure to risk. However, activity level is poorly known for free-living animals because it is difficult to quantify activity in the field in a consistent, cost-effective and non-invasive way. This article presents a new method to estimate activity level with time-of-detection data from camera traps (or more generally any remote sensors), fitting a flexible circular distribution to these data to describe the underlying activity schedule, and calculating overall proportion of time active from this. Using simulations and a case study for a range of small- to medium-sized mammal species, we find that activity level can reliably be estimated using the new method. The method depends on the key assumption that all individuals in the sampled population are active at the peak of the daily activity cycle. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence suggesting that this assumption is likely to be met for many species, but may be less likely met in large predators, or in high-latitude winters. Further research is needed to establish stronger evidence on the validity of this assumption in specific cases; however, the approach has the potential to provide an effective, non-invasive alternative to existing methods for quantifying population activity levels.},

  abstract = {Seasonal adaptation is widespread among mammals of temperate and polar latitudes. The changes in physiology, morphology and behaviour are controlled by the photoneuroendocrine system that, as a first step, translates day lengths into a hormonal signal (melatonin). Decoding of the humoral melatonin signal, i.e. responses on the cellular level to slight alterations in signal duration, represents the prerequisite for appropriate timing of winter acclimatization in photoperiodic animals. Corresponding to the diversity of affected traits, several hormone systems are involved in the regulation downstream of the neural integration of photoperiodic time measurement. Results from recent studies provide new insights into seasonal control of reproduction and energy balance. Most intriguingly, the availability of thyroid hormone within hypothalamic key regions, which is a crucial determinant of seasonal transitions, appears to be regulated by hormone secretion from the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland. This proposed neuroendocrine pathway contradicts the common view of the pituitary as a gland that acts downstream of the hypothalamus. In the present overview of (neuro)endocrine mechanisms underlying seasonal acclimatization, we are focusing on the dwarf hamster Phodopus sungorus (longday breeder) that is known for large amplitudes in seasonal changes. However, important findings in other mammalian species such as Syrian hamsters and sheep (short-day breeder) are considered as well.},

  abstract = {Animal movement, as measured by the overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), has recently been shown to correlate well with energy expenditure. However, accelerometers measure a summed acceleration derived from 2 components: static (due to gravity) and dynamic (due to motion). Since only the dynamic component is necessary for the calculation of ODBA, there is a need to establish a robust method for determining dynamic acceleration, currently done by substracting static values from the total acceleration. This study investigated the variability in ODBA arising from deriving static acceleration by smoothing total acceleration over different durations. ODBA was calculated for 3 different modes of locomotion within 1 species (the imperial shag) and for swimming in 4 species of marine vertebrates that varied considerably in body size. ODBA was found to vary significantly with the length of the running mean. Furthermore, the variability of ODBA across running means appeared to be related to the stroke period and hence body size. The results suggest that the running mean should be taken over a minimum period of 3 s for species with a dominant stroke period of up to this value. For species with a dominant stroke period above 3 s, it is suggested that static acceleration be derived over a period of no less than 1 stroke cycle.},

HR and Tb signals were transmitted via short-distance UHF link to a repeater system located in a collar unit. The collar unit decoded and processed signals received from the ruminal unit, measured LA with two different activity sensors and transmitted pulse interval-modulated VHF signals over distances of up to 10 km., 3. HR data measured with the new device contained noise caused by reticulum contractions and animal movements that triggered the acceleration sensor in the ruminal unit. We have developed a software filter to remove this noise. Hence, the system was only capable of measuring HR in animals that showed little or no activity and in the absence of rumen contractions. Reliability of this `stationary HR' measurement was confirmed with a second independent measurement of HR detected by an electrocardiogram in a domestic sheep (Ovis aries)., 4. In addition, we developed an algorithm to correctly classify an animal as `active' or `at rest' during each 3-min interval from the output of the activity sensors. Comparison with direct behavioural observations on free-ranging Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) showed that 87\% of intervals were classified correctly., 5. First results from applications of this new technique in free-ranging Alpine ibex underlined its suitability for reliable and long-term monitoring of physiological and behavioural parameters in ruminants under harsh field conditions. With the battery settings and measurement cycles used in this study, we achieved a system lifetime of approximately 2 years.},

The design is a solution to an ecological problem posed by the environment and subject to constraints intrinsic to the organism. Work on life histories has expanded the role of phenotypes in evolutionary theory, extending the range of predictions from genetic patterns to whole-organism traits directly connected to fitness. Among the questions answered are the following: Why are organisms small or large? Why do they mature early or late? Why do they have few or many offspring? Why do they have a short or a long life? Why must they grow old and die? The classical approach to life histories was optimization; it has had some convincing empirical success. Recently non-equilibrium approaches involving frequency-dependence, density-dependence, evolutionary game theory, adaptive dynamics, and explicit population dynamics have supplanted optimization as the preferred approach. They have not yet had as much empirical success, but there are logical reasons to prefer them, and they may soon extend the impact of life history theory into population dynamics and interspecific interactions in coevolving communities.},

  abstract = {The miniaturization and affordability of new technology is driving a biologging revolution in wildlife ecology with use of animal-borne data logging devices. Among many new biologging technologies, accelerometers are emerging as key tools for continuously recording animal behavior. Yet a critical, but under-acknowledged consideration in biologging is the trade-off between sampling rate and sampling duration, created by battery- (or memory-) related sampling constraints. This is especially acute among small animals, causing most researchers to sample at high rates for very limited durations. Here, we show that high accuracy in behavioral classification is achievable when pairing low-frequency acceleration recordings with temperature. We conducted 84 hr of direct behavioral observations on 67 free-ranging red squirrels (200\textendash 300 g) that were fitted with accelerometers (2 g) recording tri-axial acceleration and temperature at 1 Hz. We then used a random forest algorithm and a manually created decision tree, with variable sampling window lengths, to associate observed behavior with logger recorded acceleration and temperature. Finally, we assessed the accuracy of these different classifications using an additional 60 hr of behavioral observations, not used in the initial classification. The accuracy of the manually created decision tree classification using observational data varied from 70.6\% to 91.6\% depending on the complexity of the tree, with increasing accuracy as complexity decreased. Short duration behavior like running had lower accuracy than long-duration behavior like feeding. The random forest algorithm offered similarly high overall accuracy, but the manual decision tree afforded the flexibility to create a hierarchical tree, and to adjust sampling window length for behavioral states with varying durations. Low frequency biologging of acceleration and temperature allows accurate behavioral classification of small animals over multi-month sampling durations. Nevertheless, low sampling rates impose several important limitations, especially related to assessing the classification accuracy of short duration behavior.},

The circadian thermoenergetics (CTE) hypothesis postulates that switches in activity timing are a response to energetic challenges; daytime activity reduces thermoregulatory costs by consolidating activity to the warmest part of the day. Studying wild animals under both captive and natural conditions can increase understanding of how temporal activity patterns are shaped by the environment and could serve as a test of the CTE hypothesis. We estimated the effects of activity timing on energy expenditure for the tuco-tuco by combining laboratory measurements of metabolic rate with environmental temperature records in both winter and summer. We showed that, in winter, there would be considerable energy savings if activity is allocated at least partially during daylight, lending support to the CTE hypothesis. In summer, the impact of activity timing on energy expenditure is small, suggesting that during this season other factors, such as predation risk, water balance, and social interaction, may have more important roles than energetics in the determination of activity time.},

Although they live in underground burrows where environmental cycles are attenuated, they display robust, 24 h locomotor activity rhythms that are synchronized by light/dark cycles, both in laboratory and field conditions. The underground environment also poses energetic challenges (e.g. high-energy demands of digging, hypoxia, high humidity, low food availability) that have motivated thermoregulation studies in several subterranean rodent species. By using chronobiological protocols, the present work aims to contribute towards these studies by exploring day-night variations of thermoregulatory functions in tuco-tucos, starting with body temperature and its temporal relationship to locomotor activity. Animals showed daily, 24 h body temperature rhythms that persisted even in constant darkness and temperature, synchronizing to a daily light/dark cycle, with highest values occurring during darkness hours. The range of oscillation of body temperature was slightly lower than those reported for similar-sized and dark-active rodents. Most rhythmic parameters, such as period and phase, did not change upon removal of the running wheel. Body temperature and locomotor activity rhythms were robustly associated in time. The former persisted even after removal of the acute effects of intense activity on body temperature by a statistical method. Finally, regression gradients between body temperature and activity were higher in the beginning of the night, suggesting day-night variation in thermal conductance and heat production. Consideration of these day-night variations in thermoregulatory processes is beneficial for further studies on thermoregulation and energetics of subterranean rodents.},

  abstract = {Conservation translocations aim to restore species to their indigenous ranges, protect populations from threats and/or reinstate ecosystem functions. They are particularly important for the conservation and management of rare and threatened species. Despite tremendous efforts and advancement in recent years, animal conservation translocations generally have variable s\- uccess, and the reasons for this are often uncertain. We suggest that when little is known about the physiology and wellbeing of individuals either before or after release, it will be difficult to determine their likelihood of survival, and this could limit advancements in the science of translocations for conservation. In this regard, we argue that physiology offers novel approaches that could substantially improve translocations and associated practices. As a discipline, it is apparent that physiology may be undervalued, perhaps because of the invasive nature of some physiological measurement techniques (e.g. sampling body fluids, s\- urgical implantation). We examined 232 publications that dealt with translocations of terrestrial vertebrates and aquatic mammals and, defining `success' as high or low, determined how many of these studies explicitly incorporated physiological aspects into their protocols and monitoring. From this review, it is apparent that physiological evaluation before and after animal releases could progress and improve translocation/reintroduction successes. We propose a suite of physiological measures, in addition to animal health indices, for assisting conservation translocations over the short term and also for longer term post-release m\- onitoring. Perhaps most importantly, we argue that the incorporation of physiological assessments of animals at all stages of translocation can have important welfare implications by helping to reduce the total number of animals used. Physiological indicators can also help to refine conservation translocation methods. These approaches fall under a new paradigm that we term `translocation physiology' and represent an important sub-discipline within conservation physiology generally.},

In temperate zones mammals exhibit pronounced seasonal reproduction because of thermoregulation costs imposed by low winter temperatures and limited food availability. Even occupying burrows that buffer external ambient conditions, these restrictions also affect subterranean rodents inhabiting these latitudes. Tuco-tucos (genus Ctenomys) are subterranean herbivorous rodents that have a Neotropical distribution between 17 and 541 of latitude S. Ctenomys rionegrensis is one of the three species occurring in Uruguay and generated interest due to chromatic polymorphism in a restricted area (50 \^A 60 km). Here we describe the timing of breeding in C. rionegrensis based on the reproductive status of free-living females and the proportion of juveniles in the population, and describe the characteristics of the estrous cycle of the species using cytological techniques. As expected, the data showed a clear seasonality in female breeding and provided evidence of the occurrence of post-partum estrous. The reproductive activity began in late austral autumn and the highest proportion of pregnant females was observed in winter. At the beginning of the austral spring, the prevalence of lactating females increased as a consequence of the first births and remained high until early summer. This pattern of breeding seasonality was clearly correlated with the annual temperature variation. The estrous cycle showed four phases characterized by both different cellular types and the abundance and appearance of mucus, which allows a clear determination of female's reproductive status.},

  abstract = {BackgroundMammals in the far north are exposed to extreme seasonal changes in environmental conditions, such as temperature and photoperiod, which have notable effects on animal physiology and behaviour. The wolverine (Gulo gulo) is a carnivore with a circumpolar distribution and well-adapted to extreme environmental conditions. Still, ecophysiological studies on free-ranging wolverines are lacking. In this study, we used abdominally implanted body temperature loggers in combination with GPS collars with acceleration sensors on 14 free-ranging wolverines in northern Sweden to study daily and seasonal variation in body temperature and activity patterns. We used generalized additive mixed modelling to investigate body temperature patterns over time and Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis to analyse circadian rhythms.ResultsWe found that wolverines have an average core body temperature of 38.5\,{$\pm$}\,0.2\,\textdegree C with a daily variation of up to 6\,\textdegree C. Body temperature patterns varied between reproductive states. Pregnant females showed a distinct decrease in body temperature during gestation. Wolverines were active both in day and night, but displayed distinct activity peaks during crepuscular hours. However, body temperature and activity patterns changed seasonally, with a gradual change from a unimodal pattern in winter with concentrated activity during the short period of day light to a bimodal pattern in autumn with activity peaks around dusk and dawn. Wolverines were less likely to display 24-h rhythms in winter, when hours of day light are limited.ConclusionsThe combination of different biologging techniques gave novel insight into the ecophysiology, activity patterns and reproductive biology of free-ranging wolverines, adding important knowledge to our understanding of animals adapted to cold environments at northern latitudes.},

Information was collected on a tracking yacht using a combination of sonic and radio telemetry. Diving heart rate declined as a function of dive duration. In long dives, grey seals employed extreme bradycardia, with heart rates falling to 4 beats min-1 for extended periods, despite the animal being free to breath at will. This extreme dive response is part of the normal foraging behaviour. Seals spent 89\% of the time submerged during bouts of long dives; swimming was restricted to ascent and descent. Dive durations exceeded estimated aerobic dive limit, even assuming resting metabolic rates. These results indicate that behavioural, and possibly cellular, energy-sparing mechanisms play an important role in diving behaviour of grey seals. This has implications not only for studies of mammalian energetics but also for our understanding of the foraging tactics and prey selection of marine mammals. If some seals are using energy-sparing mechanisms to reduce metabolic costs while at depth, they may be forced to wait for and ambush prey rather than to search for and chase it.},

We measured metabolic rate and body temperature in hibernating black bears and found that they suppress metabolism to 25\% of basal rates while regulating body temperature from 30\textdegree{} to 36\textdegree C, in multiday cycles. Heart rates were reduced from 55 to as few as 9 beats per minute, with profound sinus arrhythmia. After returning to normal body temperature and emerging from dens, bears maintained a reduced metabolic rate for up to 3 weeks. The pronounced reduction and delayed recovery of metabolic rate in hibernating bears suggest that the majority of metabolic suppression during hibernation is independent of lowered body temperature. Hibernating black bears suppress their metabolic rate to 25\% of normal, but only slightly reduce their body temperature.

However, several reports in the field suggested that a substantial amount of activity occurs during daylight hours, leading us to question whether circadian entrainment in the laboratory accurately reflects behavior in natural conditions. We compared circadian patterns of locomotor activity in DD of animals previously entrained to full laboratory LD cycles (LD12:12) with those of animals that were trapped directly from the field. In both cases, activity onsets in DD immediately reflected the previous dark onset or sundown. Furthermore, freerunning periods upon release into DD were close to 24 h indicating aftereffects of prior entrainment, similarly in both conditions. No difference was detected in the phase of activity measured with and without access to a running wheel. However, when individuals were observed continuously during daylight hours in a semi-natural enclosure, they emerged above-ground on a daily basis. These day-time activities consisted of foraging and burrow maintenance, suggesting that the designation of this species as nocturnal might be inaccurate in the field. Our study of a solitary subterranean species suggests that the circadian clock is entrained similarly under field and laboratory conditions and that day-time activity expressed only in the field is required for foraging and may not be time-dictated by the circadian pacemaker.},

  abstract = {In small animals like mice, the monitoring of endocrine functions over time is constrained seriously by the adverse effects of blood sampling. Therefore, noninvasive techniques to monitor, for example, stress hormones in these animals are highly demanded in laboratory as well as in field research. The aim of our study was to evaluate the biological relevance of a recently developed technique to monitor stress hormone metabolites in fecal samples of laboratory mice. In total, six experiments were performed using six male and six female mice each. Two adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge tests, two dexamethasone (Dex) suppression tests and two control experiments [investigating effects of the injection procedure itself and the diurnal variation (DV) of glucocorticoids (GCs), respectively] were conducted. The experiments clearly demonstrated that pharmacological stimulation and suppression of adrenocortical activity was reflected accurately by means of corticosterone metabolite (CM) measurements in the feces of males and females. Furthermore, the technique proved sensitive enough to detect dosage-dependent effects of the ACTH/Dex treatment and facilitated to reveal profound effects of the injection procedure itself. Even the naturally occurring DV of GCs could be monitored reliably. Thus, our results confirm that measurement of fecal CM with the recently established 5a-pregnane-3h,11h,21-triol-20-one enzyme immunoassay is a very powerful tool to monitor adrenocortical activity in laboratory mice. Since mice represent the vast majority of all rodents used for research worldwide and the number of transgenic and knockout mice utilized as animal models is still increasing, this noninvasive technique can open new perspectives in biomedical and behavioral science.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the noninvasive monitoring of steroid hormone metabolites in feces of mammals and droppings of birds has become an increasingly popular technique. It offers several advantages and has been applied to a variety of species under various settings. However, using this technique to reliably assess an animal's adrenocortical activity is not that simple and straightforward to apply. Because clear differences regarding the metabolism and excretion of glucocorticoid metabolites (GCMs) exist, a careful validation for each species and sex investigated is obligatory. In this review, general analytical issues regarding sample storage, extraction procedures, and immunoassays are briefly discussed, but the main focus lies on experiments and recommendations addressing the validation of fecal GCM measurements in mammals and birds. The crucial importance of scrutinizing the physiological and biological validity of fecal GCM analyses in a given species is stressed. In particular, the relevance of the technique to detect biologically meaningful alterations in adrenocortical activity must be shown. Furthermore, significant effects of the animals' sex, the time of day, season, and different life history stages are discussed, bringing about the necessity to seriously consider possible sex differences as well as diurnal and seasonal variations. Thus, comprehensive information on the animals' biology and stress physiology should be carefully taken into account. Together with an extensive physiological and biological validation, this will ensure that the measurement of fecal GCMs can be used as a powerful tool to assess adrenocortical activity in diverse investigations on laboratory, companion, farm, zoo, and wild animals.},

  abstract = {At temperate latitudes, mammals and birds use changes in day length to time their reproductive activities to coincide with seasonal Xuctuations in the environment. Close to the equator, however, conditions permissive of breeding do not track changes in day length as well, so other cues may be more important than photoperiod. In a variety of vertebrates, social interactions regulate breeding condition. We hypothesized that individuals of diVerent species of Peromyscus mice found closer to the equator would respond more strongly to housing with an opposite sex conspeciWc than they would to photoperiod. To test this hypothesis, we compared the eVects of long and short day lengths versus 8 days of pair housing with a female on reproductive tissue weights and testosterone (T) concentrations in Wve species of Peromyscus (P. aztecus, P. eremicus, P. maniculatus, P. melanophrys, and P. polionotus). After 13 weeks of short days (8L:16D), P. maniculatus, P. melanophrys, and P. polionotus signiWcantly reduced relative testes mass compared to long day (16L:8D) housed animals. Social housing, however, had no eVect on tissue weights in any species. However, male P. polionotus paired with females for 8 days increased T concentrations compared to single-housed males, whereas paired P. maniculatus reduced T. These data suggest that mechanisms of photoperiodic and social regulation of reproductive function are mediated by diVerent physiological mechanisms among closelyrelated species and that both phylogeny and environmental factors contribute to patterns of reproductive plasticity.},

  abstract = {Endogenous daily (circadian) rhythms allow organisms to anticipate daily changes in the environment. Most mammals are specialized to be active during the night (nocturnal) or day (diurnal). However, typically nocturnal mammals become diurnal when energetically challenged by cold or hunger. The circadian thermo-energetics (CTE) hypothesis predicts that diurnal activity patterns reduce daily energy expenditure (DEE) compared with nocturnal activity patterns. Here, we tested the CTE hypothesis by quantifying the energetic consequences of relevant environmental factors in mice. Under natural conditions, diurnality reduces DEE by 6\textendash 10\% in energetically challenged mice. Combined with night-time torpor, as observed in mice under prolonged food scarcity, DEE can be reduced by {$\sim$}20\%. The dominant factor determining the energetic benefit of diurnality is thermal buffering provided by a sheltered resting location. Compared with nocturnal animals, diurnal animals encounter higher ambient temperatures during both day and night, leading to reduced thermogenesis costs in temperate climates. Analysis of weather station data shows that diurnality is energetically beneficial on almost all days of the year in a temperate climate region. Furthermore, diurnality provides energetic benefits at all investigated geographical locations on European longitudinal and latitudinal transects. The reduction of DEE by diurnality provides an ultimate explanation for temporal niche switching observed in typically nocturnal small mammals under energetically challenging conditions. Diurnality allows mammals to compensate for reductions in food availability and temperature as it reduces energetic needs. The optimal circadian organization of an animal ultimately depends on the balance between energetic consequences and other fitness consequences of the selected temporal niche.},

The cut-points approach to segment accelerometer data is widely used in physical activity research but requires resource expensive calibration studies and does not make it easy to explore the information that can be gained for a variety of raw data metrics. To address these limitations, we present a data-driven approach for segmenting and clustering the accelerometer data using unsupervised machine learning. Methods The data used came from five hundred fourteen-year-old participants from the Millennium cohort study who wore an accelerometer (GENEActiv) on their wrist on one weekday and one weekend day. A Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM), configured to identify a maximum of ten behavioral states from five second averaged acceleration with and without addition of x, y, and z-angles, was used for segmenting and clustering of the data. A cut-points approach was used as comparison. Results Time spent in behavioral states with or without angle metrics constituted eight and five principal components to reach 95\% explained variance, respectively; in comparison four components were identified with the cut-points approach. In the HSMM with acceleration and angle as input, the distributions for acceleration in the states showed similar groupings as the cut-points categories, while more variety was seen in the distribution of angles. Conclusion Our unsupervised classification approach learns a construct of human behavior based on the data it observes, without the need for resource expensive calibration studies, has the ability to combine multiple data metrics, and offers a higher dimensional description of},

In this study, we evaluated seasonal variations in cortisol, testosterone, and progesterone plasma levels in males and females of the subterranean rodent Ctenomys talarum. For the case of females, we also aimed to evaluate their capacity to increase their plasma cortisol concentrations in response to capture and restraint during reproductive and non-reproductive seasons. In addition, we registered concomitant seasonal variations in the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (N:L) aimed to discriminate between basal and stress-induced seasonal changes in cortisol levels in both males and females. Both basal and stressed-induced cortisol levels were significantly higher in reproductive than non-reproductive females. For the case of males, cortisol levels were also higher during the reproductive season, though values were two- to threefold lower than in females. The N:L ratios attained low values, typical of unstressed animals, in both males and females, indicating that the animals were not facing acute or chronic stressors at the moment of their capture. Testosterone levels in males were significantly elevated in relation to other mammals reaching up to 486 ng mL-1, with significantly higher levels during the reproductive season (mean: 209.45 Ϯ 177.76 ng mL-1) and a remarkable inter-individual variation. On the other hand, progesterone levels in females captured during reproductive and non-reproductive seasons were not significantly different. This study shows that seasonal modulation in testosterone and also in baseline and stress-induced cortisol levels occurs in tuco-tucos associated with reproduction.},

  abstract = {Maximising survival requires animals to balance the competing demands of maintaining energy balance and avoiding predation. Here, quantitative modelling shows that optimising the daily timing of activity and rest based on the encountered environmental conditions enables small mammals to maximise survival. Our model shows that nocturnality is typically beneficial when predation risk is higher during the day than during the night, but this is reversed by the energetic benefit of diurnality when food becomes scarce. Empirical testing under semi-natural conditions revealed that the daily timing of activity and rest in mice exposed to manipulations in energy availability and perceived predation risk is in line with the model's predictions. Low food availability and decreased perceived daytime predation risk promote diurnal activity patterns. Overall, our results identify temporal niche switching in small mammals as a strategy to maximise survival in response to environmental changes in food availability and perceived predation risk.},

  abstract = {To study the neurophysiology of large-scale spatial cognition, we analyzed the neuronal activity of navigating homing pigeons. This is not possible using conventional radio-telemetry suitable for short distances only. Therefore we developed a miniaturized data logger (``neurologger'') that can be carried by a homing pigeon on its back, in conjunction with a micro-global position system (GPS) logger recording the spatial position of the bird. In its present state, the neurologger permits recording from up to eight single-ended or differential electrodes in a walking or flying pigeon. Inputs from eight independent channels are preamplified, band-pass filtered, and directed to an eight-channel, 10-bit analog-digital converter of the microcontroller storing data on a ``Multimedia'' or ``Secure Digital'' card. For electroencephalography (EEG), the logger permits simultaneous recordings of up to eight channels during maximally 47 h, depending on memory, while single unit activity from two channels can be stored over 9 h. The logger permits single unit separation from recorded multiunit signals. The neurologger with GPS represents a better alternative to telemetry that will eventually permit to record neuronal activity during cognitive and innate behavior of many species moving freely in their habitats but will also permit automated high-throughput screening of EEG in the laboratory.},

  abstract = {Naked mole-rats form eusocial colonies consisting of a single breeding female (the queen), several breeding males, and sexually immature adults (subordinates). Subordinates are cooperative and provide alloparental care by huddling and retrieving pups to the nest. However, the physiological mechanism(s) underlying alloparental behavior of nonbreeders remains undetermined. Here, we examined the response of subordinates to pup voice and the fecal estradiol concentrations of subordinates during the three reproductive periods of the queen, including gestation, postpartum, and nonlactating. Subordinate response to pup voice was observed only during the queen's postpartum and was preceded by an incremental rise in subordinates' fecal estradiol concentrations during the queen's gestation period, which coincided with physiological changes in the queen. We hypothesized that the increased estradiol in the queen's feces was disseminated to subordinates through coprophagy, which stimulated subordinates' responses to pup vocalizations. To test this hypothesis, we fed subordinates either fecal pellets from pregnant queens or pellets from nonpregnant queens amended with estradiol for 9 days and examined their response to recorded pup voice. In both treatments, the subordinates exhibited a constant level of response to pup voice during the feeding period but became more responsive 4 days after the feeding period. Thus, we believe that we have identified a previously unknown system of communication in naked mole-rats, in which a hormone released by one individual controls the behavior of another individual and influences the level of responsiveness among subordinate adults to pup vocal signals, thereby contributing to the alloparental pup care by subordinates.},

  abstract = {In mice circadian body temperature curves are masked due to the effect of motor activity. However, body temperature will not immediately reflect activity, but rather the integrated activity over IT minutes (integration time) and after a certain delay (lag), and the sensitivity to such masking may change throughout the circadian cycle. The aims of the present investigation were to estimate IT and lag, to quantify the effect of motor activity on body temperature at different times of the day, and, using these results, to draw temperature curves that are closer to the endogenous one. Activity and body temperature of adult male laboratory mice were recorded telemetrically at 10-min intervals. Animals were housed in air-conditioned rooms (T = 22+/-2 degrees C; relative humidity: 55-65\%) with a light-dark cycle of 12 h:12 h (light from 0700 to 1900 hours) and food and water available ad lib. The diurnal activity and body temperature rhythms were similar with a main maximum during the dark time and a secondary maximum immediately following lights-on. Nearly all changes of activity were reflected in body temperature. IT and lag were established on the basis of the best correlation between body temperature and activity (overlapping 4-h sections of 12 days) for all combinations of IT from 10 to 90 min and lag from 0 to 50 min (10-min steps each). The overall means of IT and lag were 40 and 0 min, respectively. During the dark time the values were somewhat larger, but not significantly so. The correlation between activity and body temperature was significantly better in the light time compared to the dark time. The sensitivity of the body temperature to changes in activity was investigated by linear regression analysis for every hour over 12 days (IT = 40 min, lag = 0 min). The gradients assessed by regression analysis showed a diurnal pattern with maximal values during the light time (p {$<$} 0.01). Thus, body temperature was raised by activity more during the light time (minimum of body temperature and activity) than during the dark time. The intercepts showed a nearly sinusoidal diurnal pattern with maximal values in the middle of the dark time. Accepting that the intercepts correspond to zero activity at a certain time of day, one might use them to get a curve that is closer to the endogenous body temperature rhythm. Mechanisms (circadian and thermoregulatory) that might cause the diurnally changing sensitivity of body temperature to activity are discussed.},

Efforts to control this population are underway, but are hampered by a lack of information about fine-scale activity cycles and ecology of these cryptic animals in the wild. We aimed to establish a technique for monitoring the activity of Burmese pythons in the wild using acceleration data loggers (ADLs), while attempting to identify any behavioral patterns that could be used to help manage this invasive species in the Greater Everglades and South Florida. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We obtained continuous acceleration and temperature data from four wild snakes over periods of 19 to 95 days (mean 54\,{$\pm$}\,33 days). Snakes spent 86\% of their time at rest and 14\% of their time active, including transiting between locations. All snakes showed at least one period of continuous transiting lasting 10 h or more, with one animal transiting continuously for a period of 58.5 h. Acceleration data logger-derived transiting bout duration was significantly correlated with the distance snakes traveled per hour for two snakes that also carried GPS loggers. Snakes were most active in midday or early-night depending on individual and time of year, but all snakes were least likely to be active in the early mornings (0400\textendash 0700 h local time). Very little movement took place at temperatures below 14 \textdegree C or above 24 \textdegree C, with most movement taking place between 15\textdegree{} and 20 \textdegree C. One animal showed a highly unusual rolling event that may be indicative of a predation attempt, but this could not be confirmed. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Fine-scale activity and some behaviors were apparent from ADL data, making ADLs a potentially valuable, unbiased tool for monitoring large-bodied snakes in the wild. Snakes spent the majority of their time resting, but also moved continuously for several hours at a time during bouts of transiting. Results suggest that individuals may shift their diel activity pattern based on season. Understanding seasonal differences in activity levels can improve the accuracy of population estimates, help detect range expansion, and improve managers' ability to find and capture individuals.},

  abstract = {Skip to Next Section Tracking animals over large temporal and spatial scales has revealed invaluable and spectacular biological information, particularly when the paths and fates of individuals can be monitored on a global scale. However, only large animals (greater than {$\sim$}300 g) currently can be followed globally because of power and size constraints on the tracking devices. And yet the vast majority of animals is small. Tracking small animals is important because they are often part of evolutionary and ecological experiments, they provide important ecosystem services and they are of conservation concern or pose harm to human health. Here, we propose a small-animal satellite tracking system that would enable the global monitoring of animals down to the size of the smallest birds, mammals (bats), marine life and eventually large insects. To create the scientific framework necessary for such a global project, we formed the ICARUS initiative (www.IcarusInitiative.org), the International Cooperation for Animal Research Using Space. ICARUS also highlights how small-animal tracking could address some of the `Grand Challenges in Environmental Sciences' identified by the US National Academy of Sciences, such as the spread of infectious diseases or the relationship between biological diversity and ecosystem functioning. Small-animal tracking would allow the quantitative assessment of dispersal and migration in natural populations and thus help solve enigmas regarding population dynamics, extinctions and invasions. Experimental biologists may find a global small-animal tracking system helpful in testing, validating and expanding laboratory-derived discoveries in wild, natural populations. We suggest that the relatively modest investment into a global small-animal tracking system will pay off by providing unprecedented insights into both basic and applied nature. Tracking small animals over large spatial and temporal scales could prove to be one of the most powerful techniques of the early 21st century, offering potential solutions to a wide range of biological and societal questions that date back two millennia to the Greek philosopher Aristotle's enigma about songbird migration. Several of the more recent Grand Challenges in Environmental Sciences, such as the regulation and functional consequences of biological diversity or the surveillance of the population ecology of zoonotic hosts, pathogens or vectors, could also be addressed by a global small-animal tracking system. Our discussion is intended to contribute to an emerging groundswell of scientific support to make such a new technological system happen.},

We used collar-mounted light loggers to examine how nest attendance in arboreal squirrels and aboveground activity in semifossorial ground squirrels are affected by weather-driven changes in thermoregulatory conditions. Activity of lactating red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) had a diurnal pattern showing 3 daily peaks of activity with time spent outside the nest increasing with increasing ambient temperature, but decreasing with increasing relative humidity and wind. Despite the persistence of daylight during midsummer in the arctic environment, female arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii) also exhibited diurnal activity patterns with time spent above ground each day decreasing in response to precipitation but increasing with increasing ambient temperature and incident solar radiation. On cooler days, ground squirrels exhibited a unimodal activity pattern. However, on warm days, ground squirrels spent less time above ground when solar radiation and ambient temperature were both at their daily maxima, which resulted in a bimodal activity pattern. Our results highlight the utility of light loggers as a cost-effective means of addressing questions related to foraging behavior, parental care, thermoregulation, energetics, and timing of activity in arboreal and semifossorial small mammals.},

  abstract = {Summary 1 Time and energy are key currencies in animal ecology, and judicious management of these is a primary focus for natural selection. At present, however, there are only two main methods for estimation of rate of energy expenditure in the field, heart rate and doubly labelled water, both of which have been used with success; but both also have their limitations. 2 The deployment of data loggers that measure acceleration is emerging as a powerful tool for quantifying the behaviour of free-living animals. Given that animal movement requires the use of energy, the accelerometry technique potentially has application in the quantification of rate of energy expenditure during activity. 3 In the present study, we test the hypothesis that acceleration can serve as a proxy for rate of energy expenditure in free-living animals. We measured rate of energy expenditure as rates of O2 consumption () and CO2 production () in great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) at rest and during pedestrian exercise. and were then related to overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) measured with an externally attached three-axis accelerometer. 4 Both and were significantly positively associated with ODBA in great cormorants. This suggests that accelerometric measurements of ODBA can be used to estimate and and, with some additional assumptions regarding metabolic substrate use and the energy equivalence of O2 and CO2, that ODBA can be used to estimate the activity specific rate of energy expenditure of free-living cormorants. 5 To verify that the approach identifies expected trends in from situations with variable power requirements, we measured ODBA in free-living imperial cormorants (Phalacrocorax atriceps) during foraging trips. We compared ODBA during return and outward foraging flights, when birds are expected to be laden and not laden with captured fish, respectively. We also examined changes in ODBA during the descent phase of diving, when power requirements are predicted to decrease with depth due to changes in buoyancy associated with compression of plumage and respiratory air. 6 In free-living imperial cormorants, ODBA, and hence estimated , was higher during the return flight of a foraging bout, and decreased with depth during the descent phase of a dive, supporting the use of accelerometry for the determination of activity-specific rate of energy expenditure.},

  abstract = {Mammals are the so-called "pinnacle" group of vertebrates, successfully colonising virtually all terrestrial environments as well as the air (bats) and sea (especially pinnipeds and cetaceans). How mammals function and survive in these diverse environments has long fascinated mammologists, comparative physiologists and ecologists. 'Ecological and Environmental Physiology of Mammals' explores the physiological mechanisms and evolutionary necessities that have made the spectacular adaptation of mammals possible. It summarises our current knowledge of the complex and sophisticated physiological approaches that mammals have for survival in a wide variety of ecological and environmental contexts: terrestrial, aerial, and aquatic. The authors have a strong comparative and quantitative focus in their broad approach to exploring mammal ecophysiology. As with other books in the 'Ecological and Environmental Physiology Series', the emphasis is on the unique physiological characteristics of mammals, their adaptations to extreme environments, and current experimental techniques and future research directions are also considered. 0This accessible text is suitable for graduate level students and researchers in the fields of mammalian comparative physiology and physiological ecology, including specialist courses in mammal ecology. It will also be of value and use to the many professional mammologists requiring a concise overview of the topic},

Internal timekeepers evolved to anticipate environmental changes, the most important of these being the geophysical light-dark cycle, to coordinate external changes with the timing of internal processes. Research into functions of the biological clock during captive studies has provided valuable insight into mechanisms by which clocks function, and how small environmental changes can affect the clock and its outputs. However, biological clocks have so far been understudied in ecology.},

  abstract = {Circadian ( 24 h) clock regulated biological rhythms have been identified in a wide range of organisms from prokaryotic unicellular cyanobacteria to higher mammals. These rhythms regulate an enormous variety of processes including gene expression, metabolic processes, activity and reproduction. Given the widespread occurrence of circadian systems it is not surprising that extensive efforts have been directed at understanding the adaptive significance of circadian rhythms. In this review we discuss the approaches and findings that have resulted. In studies on organisms in their natural environments, some species show adaptations in their circadian systems that correlate with living at different latitudes, such as clines in circadian clock properties. Additionally, some species show plasticity in their circadian systems suggested to match the demands of their physical and social environment. A number of experiments, both in the field and in the laboratory, have examined the effects of having a circadian system that does not resonate with the organism\~Os environment. We conclude that the results of these studies suggest that having a circadian system that matches the oscillating environment is adaptive.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the maternal costs of reproduction and pup development in the subterranean rodent Ctenomys talarum (Thomas 1898). Statistical differences were detected in whole-animal metabolic rates between nonreproductive and pregnant or lactating females. Whole-animal metabolic rates during pregnancy and lactation were 128\% and 151\% of the resting metabolic rate (RMR) observed in nonreproductive females. The total additional energy cost of reproduction (above the nonreproductive level) was similar for both the gestation and lactation periods. Mass-specific RMR revealed an upregulation of cell or tissue metabolism during lactation but not during gestation. The mass-specific metabolic rate of pups was 237\% of the adults' metabolic rates. No differences were observed in body temperature among nonreproductive, pregnant, or lactating females. No differences were detected in body mass at birth among pups from litters with different numbers of nestlings. Pups increased their body temperature, reaching adult temperature at 30 d of age, when they were near weaning. Milk constituted the exclusive food for pups until they started eating solid food at 10 d old. Suckling time decreased with age of pups, and at the same time, mother chases directed toward their pups increased. These reproductive characteristics may contribute to successful existence in a subterranean habitat.},

  abstract = {Synopsis             The regulation of daily and circannual activity patterns is an important mechanism by which animals may balance energetic requirements associated with both abiotic and biotic variables. Using collar-mounted accelerometers, we assess the relative importance of reproductive stage and environmental conditions on the overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) of free-living striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis). We found that activity timing relative to photoperiod varied across seasonal stages for both sexes. Surprisingly, male skunks did not commence activity earlier than females during the mating interval. Moreover, while female skunks began activity before dusk and terminated activity after dawn during mid- through late summer (lactation period), the duration of activity bouts in females during this period was not different from other seasons. Both male and female skunks exhibited high variability and fragmentation in daily activity rhythms except during the lactation period, when females appear to switch to prolonged bouts of nocturnal activity. Overall, ODBA varied by season and sex, with changes in ODBA indicative of seasonal reproductive requirements such as conspecific competition for mates in males and lactation in females. Weather conditions had little effect on skunk activity levels except during the winter season, when snow cover and temperature negatively influenced daily ODBA. Taken together, the activity patterns of striped skunks appear to be primarily driven by seasonal investment in reproduction and secondarily by thermoregulatory constraints during the non-winter months. Our results highlight the importance of considering how environmental and reproductive drivers may interact to affect activity across both the daily and seasonal cycle.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Despite striking diversity in mammalian social behavior, studies of social organization have often dichotomized species by identifying them as either solitary or social (i.e., group living). This tendency has been particularly pronounced for subterranean rodents, the majority of which have long been assumed to be solitary. As a result, variation in social organization has likely been underestimated for these animals, particularly for species in which patterns of space use suggest limited or temporally dynamic opportunities for interactions among conspecifics. Here, we characterize patterns of space use in a population of tuco-tucos (Ctenomys sp.) from Anillaco, La Rioja Province, Argentina. Although these animals have been the subject of extensive research regarding circadian patterns of activity, spatial and social relationships among free-living individuals have not been documented. Analyses of radiotelemetry data from 17 individuals monitored during the breeding season (December 2015) revealed that partial overlap of individual home ranges was common, occurring between male–female as well as female–female pairs of animals. Spatial relationships, however, were dynamic, with both home range sizes and overlap changing on a daily basis. Although members of the study population did not meet the criteria typically used to identify group living in subterranean species, they were not completely solitary. Instead, the animals displayed an intermediate form of social organization characterized by persistent partial overlap of the areas occupied by different adults. These data add to the growing comparative picture of social variation in Ctenomys and suggest that further studies of these animals should contribute to improved understanding of the factors underlying differences in mammalian social systems.},
