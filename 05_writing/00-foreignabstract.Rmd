Temporal patterns of activity of the Anillaco tuco-tuco (Ctenomys aff. knighti), a neotropical subterranean rodent, have been extensively studied in laboratory and semi-natural enclosures. However, the laboratory-controlled settings do not fully reproduce what animals do in nature. The present study extends our understanding of tuco-tucos activity patterns and describes their daily activity in free-living conditions. We collected data from 21 tuco-tucos using animal-borne accelerometers and light loggers during 2019 and 2020, covering all seasons. Additionally, we used hidden Markov models (HMMs) to classify the accelerometer data into three distinct behavioral states that roughly correspond to rest, medium, and high-intensity activity. Lightlogger data confirms the annual change in the daily temporal pattern of surface emergence already described for animals in semi-natural enclosures. Our accelerometer data confirm that tuco-tucos are diurnal in the field, with no change in the daily temporal pattern throughout the year. Nevertheless, in July, tuco-tucos displayed a significant reduction in daily activity levels. In terms of behavioral state changes, tuco-tucos displayed significant changes in the time allocated in different states throughout the year. In July, there was a reduction in the daily time spent in high-intensity activity. However, we observed that tuco-tucos do not rest more in July; instead, they allocate more time in medium-intensity activities. These results suggest that the annual changes in daily activity levels are due to changes in the time spent in different behavioral states. All in all, we confirm that tuco-tucos are diurnal and exhibit annual changes in their general activity levels, which is probably a reflection of an annual behavioral change.
