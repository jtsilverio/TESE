    abstract   = {This chapter focuses on the energy budget of a single species (a tuco-tuco, one of Pearson's favorite beasts). It characterizes the energy budget for the South American subterranean rodent Ctenomys talarum (Talas tuco-tuco), based on new and published data on energy intake (ingestion and digestion) and expenditure (cellular maintenance, thermoregulation, digging activity, movement, pregnancy, lactation, and growth). The chapter observes that animals fed on an low-quality diet ingested more food, produced more feces, and showed lower incidence of coprophagy, lower digestibility, and reduced transit time relative to those fed a high-quality diet. It notes that this increase in food intake would assure similar total-energy assimilation as a high-quality diet, and demonstrates that tuco-tucos can adjust their ingestive and digestive processes according to the quality of the available food resources. The chapter also discusses possible extrinsic and intrinsic limitations on the C. talarum's energy budget.},

    abstract     = {In a laboratory population of unstriped Nile grass rats, Arvicanthis niloticus, individuals with two distinctly different patterns of wheel-running exist. One is diurnal and the other is relatively nocturnal. In the first experiment, the authors found that these patterns are strongly influenced by parentage and by sex. Specifically, offspring of two nocturnal parents were significantly more likely to express a nocturnal pattern of wheel-running than were offspring of diurnal parents, and more females than males were nocturnal. In the second experiment, the authors found that diurnal and nocturnal wheel-runners were indistinguishable with respect to the timing of postpartum mating, which always occurred in the hours before lights-on. Here they also found that both juvenile and adult A. niloticus exhibited diurnal patterns of general activity when housed without a wheel, even if they exhibited nocturnal activity when housed with a wheel. In the third experiment, the authors discovered that adult female A. niloticus with nocturnal patterns of wheel-running were also nocturnal with respect to general activity and core body temperature when a running wheel was available, but they were diurnal when the running wheel was removed. Finally, a field study revealed that all A. niloticus were almost exclusively diurnal in their natural habitat. Together these results suggest that individuals of this species are fundamentally diurnal but that access to a running wheel shifts some individuals to a nocturnal pattern.},

    abstract     = {Behavior is an important mechanism of evolution and it is paid for through energy expenditure. Nevertheless, field biologists can rarely observe animals for more than a fraction of their daily activities and attempts to quantify behavior for modeling ecological processes often exclude cryptic yet important behavioral events. Over the past few years, an explosion of research on remote monitoring of animal behavior using acceleration sensors has smashed the decades-old limits of observational studies. Animal-attached accelerometers measure the change in velocity of the body over time and can quantify fine-scale movements and body postures unlimited by visibility, observer bias, or the scale of space use. Pioneered more than a decade ago, application of accelerometers as a remote monitoring tool has recently surged thanks to the development of more accessible hardware and software. It has been applied to more than 120 species of animals to date. Accelerometer measurements are typically collected in three dimensions of movement at very high resolution ({$>$}10~Hz), and have so far been applied towards two main objectives. First, the patterns of accelerometer waveforms can be used to deduce specific behaviors through animal movement and body posture. Second, the variation in accelerometer waveform measurements has been shown to correlate with energy expenditure, opening up a suite of scientific questions in species notoriously difficult to observe in the wild. To date, studies of wild aquatic species outnumber wild terrestrial species and analyses of social behaviors are particularly few in number. Researchers of domestic and captive species also tend to report methodology more thoroughly than those studying species in the wild. There are substantial challenges to getting the most out of accelerometers, including validation, calibration, and the management and analysis of large quantities of data. In this review, we illustrate how accelerometers work, provide an overview of the ecological questions that have employed accelerometry, and highlight the emerging best practices for data acquisition and analysis. This tool offers a level of detail in behavioral studies of free-ranging wild animals that has previously been impossible to achieve and, across scientific disciplines, it improves understanding of the role of behavioral mechanisms in ecological and evolutionary processes.},

This can be confusing though, as data from experiments performed in a laboratory environment are sometimes different from, or completely opposite to, findings from similar experiments performed in the “real world”. In this mini-review, we discuss instances where results from laboratory experiments differ as a result of laboratory housing conditions, and where they differ from results gathered in the field environment. Experiments involving endocrinology and behavior appear to be particularly susceptible to influence from the environment in which they are performed. As such, we have attempted to promote discussion of the influence of housing environment on the reproductive axis, circadian biology and behavior, immune function, stress biology, neuroplasticity and photoperiodism. For example, why should a rodent species be diurnal in one housing environment yet nocturnal in another? Are data that are gathered from experiments in the laboratory applicable to the field environment, and vice-versa? We hope not only to highlight the need for experiments in both lab and field when looking at complex biological systems, but also to promote frank discussion of discordant data. Perhaps, just as study of individual variation has been gaining momentum in recent years, data from variation between experimental arenas can provide us with novel lines of research.},

@article{chmura2018,
    abstract     = {In this mini-review, we discuss how biologging technology can be used to detect, understand, and forecast species’ responses to climate change. We review studies of phenology, thermal biology, and microhabitat selection as examples to illustrate the utility of a biologging approach in terrestrial and aquatic species. These examples show that biologgers can be used to identify and predict behavioral and physiological responses to climatic variation and directional climate change, as well as to extreme weather events. While there is still considerable debate as to whether phenotypic plasticity is sufficient to facilitate species’ responses to climate change or whether responses to short-term climate variability are predictive of climate change response, understanding the scope and nature of plasticity is an important step toward answering these questions. One advantage of the biologging approach is that it can facilitate the measurement of traits at the level of the individual, permitting research that investigates the degree to which physiology and behavior are plastic. As such, combining biologging with metrics of fitness can provide insight into how plasticity might confer population and species resilience to climate change. Increased use of biologgers in experimental manipulations will also yield important insight into how phenotypic flexibility allows some animals to mitigate the negative consequences of climate change. Although biologging studies to date have mostly functioned in measuring phenotypic responses to short-term climate variability, we argue that integrating biologging technology into long-term monitoring programs will be instrumental in documenting and understanding ecological responses to climate change.},

@article{daan1978,
    abstract     = {Summary 1. The common vole,Microtus arvalis, like other vole species, in captivity has a short-term activity rhythm in daytime, with a period of circa two hours. Trapping records show that this rhythm exists also in field conditions, with the population in synchrony to some degree; a correlation of trapping frequency with vole predation by kestrels indicates that it reflects the true natural behaviour. 2. Lehmann's (1976) evidence inMicrotus agrestis that the short-term activity rhythm is essentially a feeding rhythm is supported for the common vole by separate recording of wheel running, feeding and nestbox occupation. 3. The short-term rhythm is phase-locked to dawn. There is fair intraindividual constancy from day to day in the timing of meals, but interindividual variation causes a gradual breakdown of population synchrony in the course of the day, both in the field and in captive isolation. 4. The frequency of the rhythm may be evolutionarily adjusted to metabolic demands of the species, as suggested by its dependence on body weight, but remains relatively invariant in the face of experimental (temperature) manipulation of metabolic expenditure. In the absence of food during the day, feeding attempts recur with the same timing as meals did before: periodic changes in satiety, related to food intake and digestion are insufficient to account for such changes in feeding motivation. 5. The risk of being killed by a kestrel is lower for voles active in phase with the population majority than for voles out of phase with the population: there is safety in numbers. Numbers vary dramatically in vole populations, however, and the generality of predatory selection for prey synchrony remains to be tested. 6. Foraging behaviour of the common vole is regulated by a circadian timing system even though feeding is spread evenly over night and day. The adaptive advantage of circadian entrustment with the timing of feeding motivation above meal timing by digestive processes is sought in the individual repetition of daily patterns as the optimal strategic answer to temporal day-to-day correlations in the environment.},

The BATS project includes a lightweight sensor node that is attached to bats and combines multiple features. Communication among sensor nodes allows tracking of bat encounters. Flight trajectories of individual tagged bats can be recorded at high spatial and temporal resolution by a ground node grid. To increase the communication range, the BATS project implemented a long-range telemetry system to still receive sensor data outside the standard ground node network. The whole system is designed with the common goal of ultra-low energy consumption while still maintaining optimal measurement results. To this end, the system is designed in a flexible way and is able to adapt its functionality according to the current situation. In this way, it uses the energy available on the sensor node as efficient as possible.},

Activity patterns were analyzed with respect to time of year and to the animal's reproductive state. Aboveground activity started on average 3.9 h (SD 0.6 h, n = 37 days) after civil twilight at dawn and ended on average 3.2 h (SD 0.9 h, n = 37 days) before civil twilight at dusk. Between onset and offset of activity, 54\% was spent aboveground, of which 73\% was spent foraging. Activity patterns were influenced by photoperiod, rainfall, and by reproductive state. During mating, reproductively active males started activity earlier than females and reproductively inactive males. For females, time spent foraging was high during lactation. The midpoint of daily activity was at 12:16 h (SD 0.37 h, n = 37 days). Activity patterns of European ground squirrels thus appear robustly positioned in the middle of the photoperiod.},

    abstract     = {Living organisms anticipate the seasons by tracking the proportion of light and darkness hours within a day—photoperiod. The limits of photoperiod measurement can be investigated in the subterranean rodents tuco-tucos (Ctenomys aff. knighti), which inhabit dark underground tunnels. Their exposure to light is sporadic and, remarkably, results from their own behavior of surface emergence. Thus, we investigated the endogenous and exogenous regulation of this behavior and its consequences to photoperiod measurement. In the field, animals carrying biologgers displayed seasonal patterns of daily surface emergence, exogenously modulated by temperature. In the laboratory, experiments with constant lighting conditions revealed the endogenous regulation of seasonal activity by the circadian clock, which has a multi-oscillatory structure. Finally, mathematical modeling corroborated that tuco-tuco’s light exposure across the seasons is sufficient for photoperiod encoding. Together, our results elucidate the interrelationship between the circadian clock and temperature in shaping seasonal light exposure patterns that convey photoperiod information in an extreme photic environment.},

    abstract     = {Subterranean rodents spend most of the day inside underground tunnels, where there is little daily change in environmental variables. Our observations of tuco-tucos (Ctenomys aff. knighti) in a field enclosure indicated that these animals perceive the aboveground light-dark cycle by several bouts of light-exposure at irregular times during the light hours of the day. To assess whether such light-dark pattern acts as an entraining agent of the circadian clock, we first constructed in laboratory the Phase Response Curve for 1 h light-pulses (1000lux). Its shape is qualitatively similar to other curves reported in the literature and to our knowledge it is the first Phase Response Curve of a subterranean rodent. Computer simulations were performed with a non-linear limit-cycle oscillator subjected to a simple model of the light regimen experienced by tuco-tucos. Results showed that synchronization is achieved even by a simple regimen of a single daily light pulse scattered uniformly along the light hours of the day. Natural entrainment studies benefit from integrated laboratory, field and computational approaches.},

    abstract     = {Time-stamped camera data are increasingly used to study temporal patterns in species and community ecology, including species’ activity patterns and niche partitioning. Given the importance of niche partitioning for facilitating coexistence between sympatric species, understanding how emerging environmental stressors – climate and landscape change, biodiversity loss and concomitant changes to community composition – affect temporal niche partitioning is of immediate importance for advancing ecological theory and informing management decisions. A large variety of analytical approaches have been applied to camera-trap data to ask key questions about species activity patterns and temporal overlap among heterospecifics. Despite the many advances for describing and quantifying these temporal patterns, few studies have explicitly tested how interacting biotic and abiotic variables influence species’ activity and capacity to segregate along the temporal niche axis. To address this gap, we suggest coordinated distributed experiments to capture sufficient camera-trap data across a range of anthropogenic stressors and community compositions. This will facilitate a standardized approach to assessing the impacts of multiple variables on species’ behaviours and interactions. Ultimately, further integration of spatial and temporal analyses of camera-trap data is critical for improving our understanding of how anthropogenic activities and landscape changes are altering competitive interactions and the dynamics of animal communities.},

Common voles were subjected to short light-dark cycles (1 hr darkness with light varying between 0.7 and 2.5 hr); to T cycles (long light-dark cycles in the circadian range\&mdash;16 hr darkness and 3-13 hr light); to light pulses (15 min) during different circadian and ultradian phases; and to addition of O 2 D to the drinking water (25\%).

For the current review, we focus on the 24-h domain generated through the earth’s rotation around its axis (solar day). The daily environmental cycles of light and temperature are a dominant ecological factor generating a variety of adaptations among animals. In this review, we describe these adaptations with a special focus on the visual system and on the adaptive plasticity of activity patterns. Our goals are: (1) Underscore the importance of the 24-h time axis as critical variable in the ecological niche. (2) Highlight cases of temporal niche switches at the evolutionary timescale (phylogenetic level). (3) Review temporal niche switching within an individual’s lifespan. (4) Evaluate possible underlying mechanisms for temporal niche switching. (5) Describe a new hypothesis of circadian thermoenergetics which may explain several cases of temporal niche switching in mammals. With this, we hope to inspire experiments under natural conditions or more complex laboratory environments, aimed to reveal environmental factors and mechanisms underlying specific temporal programs.},

The animals emerged on average 4.02 h (SD = 0.45) after civil twilight at dawn and retreated in their burrows on average 2.87 h (SD = 0.47) before civil twilight at dusk. Daily patterns of light perceived by these burrowing mammals were measured with light-sensitive radio collar transmitters in an enclosure (the Netherlands) and in the field (Hungary). The observational data are corroborated by the telemetry data, which show clear daily patterns of timing of light perception including light perceived from the burrow entrances. The first light was observed by the animals on average 3.54 h (enclosure, SD = 0.45) and 3.60 h (field, SD = 0.31) after civil twilight at dawn, whereas the final observed light was on average 3.04 h (enclosure, SD = 0.64) and 2.02 h (field, SD = 0.72) before civil twilight at dusk. Thus, the animals do not perceive the rapid natural light-dark (LD) transitions that occur at civil twilight. Instead, they generate their own pattern of exposure to light within the natural LD cycle. The classical phase response model for entrainment by light or dark pulses cannot explain how the circadian system of this species remains entrained to the external, natural LD cycle while the major LD transitions are created by its own behavior.},

    abstract  = {Circadian clocks are ubiquitous throughout the Tree of Life, being present in organisms from bacteria to mammals. These clocks are generally thought to increase the fitness of organisms by allowing the anticipation of and preparation for the predictable daily changes associated with Earth's rotation. Here we consider what it takes to show that clocks indeed increase fitness and adaptiveness, as well as what bacteria can tell us about the evolution of clocks. We give a historical panorama of the experimental approaches that attempted to demonstrate the adaptive value of circadian clocks and explore current and future experiments that could facilitate an understanding of the adaptiveness of clocks in both intra- and interspecific contexts. Finally, we explain how studying bacteria can generate a greater appreciation and understanding for the general principles of the adaptive value of circadian clocks not only towards the daily cycle but also for the seasonal cycle, from both a past and future evolutionary perspective.},

We also measured activity and ambient light exposures in denning wild bears to determine if rhythms were evident and what the photic conditions of their natural dens were. Lastly, we used cultured skin fibroblasts obtained from captive torpid bears to assess molecular clock operation in peripheral tissues.

    abstract     = {Dipodomys microps, D. merriami, and Perognatlius longitnembrisspend most of their lives solitarily and in the ground, coming out onto the surface only at night and foraging for as little as an hour. However, they are active within their burrows throughout the day, seldom remaining motionless for more than half an hour at a time during the warmer parts of the year. All three species rest at positions in their burrows which are generally at the nearest of available temperaturesto the lower end of thermal neutrality,but not warmer than 30? C. To do this, they occupy differentdepths at differentseasons and in some cases differenttimes of day. Daily vertical movements are most common in P. longimembris,because it maintains tunnels as near as 1 cm from the surface, where daily fluctuations in temperature are profound. In late fall, winter, and early spring all three species occupy nests, which serve to reduce metabolic expenditure. Energetic strategiesdifferinterspecificallyin relation to differencesin body weight among the species: D. microps (56 g), D. merriami (35 g), and P. longimenmbris(7 g). The amount of surface activity in the populations and the frequency of movement measured in individuals decrease during colder parts of the year. This decrease is most apparent in the smaller species, and is related to the decreasing success at foraging later in the season and the increasing costs of metabolism at colder temperatures. Surface activity in D. microps and D. mnerriamciontinues throughoutthe year, at temperaturesmeasured as low as -190 C. However, for P. iongimembristhe costs of foraging in winter usually far outweigh the yield, and the mice become continuously fossorial for up to 5 months of the year, living on seeds that they have cached in their burrows, and spending a great deal of time in dormancy. Seasonal cycles of body weight and reproduction are not synchronous in D. microps and D. merriami, because of differences in diet and foraging behavior. Dipodomys merriami, which is primarilya seed eater, requires the green vegetation of annual plants to reproduce, and therefore this species increases body weight and reproduces at sporadic intervals according to the unpredictable availability of annuals. Dipodomys inicrops, however, reproduces in a brief,annually consistentperiod because leaves of perennial shrubs are its primary yearround food and water resource. This larger kangaroo rat forages over a smaller area for leaves than D. merriami does for seeds; but D. merriamnri uns 50\% faster, which should compensate for the cost of moving greater distances. Dipodomys microps is most active during the firstpart of the night,but D. merriamibecomes more active during the course of the night as the activityof D. microps decreases. Height and breadth of burrow hillocks and height of shrubs on hillocks were significantlylarger for D. microps than the other species, but height of burrow hillocks and shrubs on them did not differ between D. merriami and P. longimembris. Perognathus longimembris resembles D. inerriami more than it does D. microps in diet and reproductive pattern, but in winters of great food scarcity competition between P. Iongimembrisand D. merriami is reduced by the total absence of P. longimembris from the surface.},

    abstract     = {Daily rhythms of physiology and behaviour are governed by an endogenous timekeeping mechanism (a circadian ‘clock’), with the alternation of environmental light and darkness synchronizing (entraining) these rhythms to the natural day–night cycle. Our knowledge of the circadian system of animals at the molecular, cellular, tissue and organismal levels is remarkable, and we are beginning to understand how each of these levels contributes to the emergent properties and increased complexity of the system as a whole. For the most part, these analyses have been carried out using model organisms in standard laboratory housing, but to begin to understand the adaptive significance of the clock, we must expand our scope to study diverse animal species from different taxonomic groups, showing diverse activity patterns, in their natural environments. The seven papers in this Special Feature of               Proceedings of the Royal Society B               take on this challenge, reviewing the influences of moonlight, latitudinal clines, evolutionary history, social interactions, specialized temporal niches, annual variation and recently appreciated post-transcriptional molecular mechanisms. The papers emphasize that the complexity and diversity of the natural world represent a powerful experimental resource.},

    abstract     = {▪ Abstract\hspace{0.6em} Animal species have evolved different diel activity rhythms that are of adaptive value. Theory suggests that diel temporal partitioning may facilitate coexistence between competitors and between predators and prey. However, relatively few studies demonstrate a temporal shift that is predation- or competition-induced. Recorded shifts are usually within the preferred activity phase of animal species (day or night), although there are some inversions to the opposite phase cycle. Temporal partitioning is not perceived as a common mechanism of coexistence. This rarity has been variously ascribed to theoretical considerations and to the rigidity of time-keeping mechanisms, as well as to other physiological and anatomical traits that may constrain activity patterns. Our decade-long study of spiny mice of rocky deserts demonstrates that, while different factors select for activity patterns, endogenous rhythmicity may be an evolutionary constraint.},

    abstract     = {Examples of animals that switch activity times between nocturnality and diurnality in nature are relatively infrequent. Furthermore, the mechanism for switching activity time is not clear: does a complete inversion of the circadian system occur in conjunction with activity pattern? Are there switching centers downstream from the internal clock that interpret the clock differently? Or does the switch reflect a masking effect? Answering these key questions may shed light on the mechanisms regulating activity patterns and their evolution. The golden spiny mouse (Acomys russatus) can switch between nocturnal and diurnal activity. This study investigated the relationship between its internal circadian clock and its diurnal activity pattern observed in the field. The goal is to understand the mechanisms underlying species rhythm shifts in order to gain insight into the evolution of activity patterns. All golden spiny mice had opposite activity patterns in the field than those under controlled continuous dark conditions in the laboratory. Activity and body temperature patterns in the field were diurnal, while in the laboratory all individuals immediately showed a free-running rhythm starting with a nocturnal pattern. No phase transients were found toward the preferred nocturnal activity pattern, as would be expected in the case of true entrainment. Moreover, the fact that the free-running activity patterns began from the individuals' subjective night suggests that golden spiny mice are nocturnal and that their diurnality in their natural habitat in the field results from a change that is downstream to the internal clock or reflects a masking effect.},

    abstract     = {Background Sleep is an inactive state of reduced environmental awareness shared by all animals. When compared to wakefulness, sleep behavior is associated with changes in physiology and brain activity. The nature of these changes varies considerably across species, and therefore is a rich resource for gaining insight into the evolution and functions of sleep. A major obstacle to capitalizing on this resource is the lack of a small device capable of recording multiple biological parameters for extended periods of time both in the laboratory and the field. New method ONEIROS is a new tool designed for conducting sleep research on small, freely moving animals. The miniature, standalone system is capable of recording up to 26 electrophysiological signals (electroencephalogram, electromyogram, electrooculogram, electrocardiogram), metabolic (3 temperature channels) and behavior via an accelerometer for several days. In addition, the device is equipped with a vibrating motor which can be used to assess arousal thresholds and to disrupt sleep. The system is available in telemetric or data-logger configuration useable in the field. Results To demonstrate the efficacy of this tool, we simultaneously recorded for the first time, electroencephalogram, hippocampal local field potential, electromyogram, electrooculogram, brain, body and ambient temperature, and 3D accelerometry. We also deprived rats of paradoxical sleep by triggering the vibrating motor after online recognition of the state. Finally, by successfully recording a pigeon in an 8\,m3 aviary in a social context with the device in the logger configuration, we demonstrate the feasibility of using the device in the field.},

    abstract     = {The landscape of fear has profound effects on the species behavior, with most organisms engaging in risk avoidance behaviors in areas perceived as riskier. Most risk avoidance behaviors, such as temporal avoidance, have severe trade-offs between foraging efficiency and risk reduction. Human activities are able to affect the species landscape of fear, by increasing mortality of individuals (i.e. hunting, roadkill) and by disruption of the clues used by the species to estimate predation risk (e.g. light pollution). In this study, we used an extensive camera-trapping and night-time light satellite imagery to evaluate whether human activities affect the diel activity patterns of 17 species of rainforest dwelling mammals. We found evidence of diel activity shifts in eight of 17 analyzed species, in which five species become 21.6 \% more nocturnal and three species become 11.7\% more diurnal in high disturbed areas. This activity shifts were observed for both diurnal and nocturnal species. Persecuted species (game and predators) were more susceptible to present activity shifts. Since changes in foraging activity may affect species fitness, the behavior of humans’ avoidance may be another driver of the Anthropocene defaunation.},

@article{rattenborg2008,
    abstract     = {The functions of sleep remain an unresolved question in biology. One approach to revealing sleep's purpose is to identify traits that explain why some species sleep more than others. Recent comparative studies of sleep have identified relationships between various physiological, neuroanatomical and ecological traits, and the time mammals spend in rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep. However, owing to technological constraints, these studies were based exclusively on animals in captivity. Consequently, it is unclear to what extent the unnatural laboratory environment affected time spent sleeping, and thereby the identification and interpretation of informative clues to the functions of sleep. We performed the first electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of sleep on unrestricted animals in the wild using a recently developed miniaturized EEG recorder, and found that brown-throated three-toed sloths (Bradypus variegatus) inhabiting the canopy of a tropical rainforest only sleep 9.63 h d(-1), over 6 h less than previously reported in captivity. Although the influence of factors such as the age of the animals studied cannot be ruled out, our results suggest that sleep in the wild may be markedly different from that in captivity. Additional studies of various species are thus needed to determine whether the relationships between sleep duration and various traits identified in captivity are fundamentally different in the wild. Our initial study of sloths demonstrates the feasibility of this endeavour, and thereby opens the door to comparative studies of sleep occurring within the ecological context within which it evolved.},

However, the considerable size of many sophisticated biologging devices restricts their application to larger animals, while old-fashioned techniques often still represent the state-of-the-art for studying small vertebrates. In industrial applications, low-power wireless sensor networks fulfill requirements similar to those needed to monitor animal behavior at high resolution and at low tag weight. We developed a wireless biologging network (WBN), which enables simultaneous direct proximity sensing, high-resolution tracking, and long-range remote data download at tag weights of one to two grams. Deployments to study wild bats created social networks and flight trajectories of unprecedented quality. Our developments highlight the vast capabilities of WBNs and their potential to close an important gap in biologging: fully automated tracking and proximity sensing of small animals, even in closed habitats, at high spatial and temporal resolution.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

    abstract     = {Female bats of temperate zones often communally rear their young, which creates ideal conditions for naive juveniles to find or learn about resources via informed adults. However, studying social information transfer in elusive and small-bodied animals in the wild is difficult with traditional tracking techniques. We used a novel ‘next-generation’ proximity sensor system (BATS) to investigate if and how juvenile bats use social information in acquiring access to two crucial resources: suitable roosts and food patches. By tracking juvenile–adult associations during roost switching and foraging, we found evidence for mother-to-offspring information transfer while switching roosts but not during foraging. Spatial and temporal patterns of encounters suggested that mothers guided juveniles between the juvenile and the target roost. This roost-switching behaviour provides evidence for maternal guidance in bats, a form of maternal care that has long been assumed, but never documented. We did not find evidence that mothers guide the offspring to foraging sites. Foraging bats reported brief infrequent meetings with other tagged bats that were best explained by local enhancement. Our study illustrates how this recent advance in automated biologging provides researchers with new insights into longstanding questions in behavioural biology.},

    abstract     = {Animal-attached remote sensing, or bio-logging, refers to the deployment of autonomous recording tags on free-living animals, so that multiple variables can be monitored at rates of many times per second, thereby generating millions of data points over periods ranging from hours to years. Rapid advances in technology are allowing scientists to use data-recording units to acquire huge, quantitative datasets of behavior from animals moving freely in their natural environment. In other words, scientists can examine wild animals in the field, behaving normally, with the same rigor that is normally used in the laboratory. The flexibility of such recording systems means that bio-logging science operates at the interface of several biological disciplines, looking at a wide array of aquatic, airborne, and terrestrial species, monitoring not only the physical characteristics of the environment, but also the animal's reactions to it. This approach is critically important in an era when global change threatens the survival of species and where habitat loss is leading to widespread extinctions.},

    abstract     = {Activity level (the proportion of time that animals spend active) is a behavioural and ecological metric that can provide an indicator of energetics, foraging effort and exposure to risk. However, activity level is poorly known for free-living animals because it is difficult to quantify activity in the field in a consistent, cost-effective and non-invasive way. This article presents a new method to estimate activity level with time-of-detection data from camera traps (or more generally any remote sensors), fitting a flexible circular distribution to these data to describe the underlying activity schedule, and calculating overall proportion of time active from this. Using simulations and a case study for a range of small- to medium-sized mammal species, we find that activity level can reliably be estimated using the new method. The method depends on the key assumption that all individuals in the sampled population are active at the peak of the daily activity cycle. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence suggesting that this assumption is likely to be met for many species, but may be less likely met in large predators, or in high-latitude winters. Further research is needed to establish stronger evidence on the validity of this assumption in specific cases; however, the approach has the potential to provide an effective, non-invasive alternative to existing methods for quantifying population activity levels.},

    abstract     = {1. Measuring physiological and behavioural parameters in free-ranging animals – and therefore under fully natural conditions – is of general biological concern but difficult to perform., 2. We have developed a minimally invasive telemetry system for ruminants that is capable of measuring heart rate (HR), body temperature (Tb) and locomotor activity (LA). A ruminal transmitter unit was per os placed into the reticulum and therefore located in close proximity to the heart. The unit detected HR by the use of an acceleration sensor and also measured Tb. HR and Tb signals were transmitted via short-distance UHF link to a repeater system located in a collar unit. The collar unit decoded and processed signals received from the ruminal unit, measured LA with two different activity sensors and transmitted pulse interval-modulated VHF signals over distances of up to 10 km., 3. HR data measured with the new device contained noise caused by reticulum contractions and animal movements that triggered the acceleration sensor in the ruminal unit. We have developed a software filter to remove this noise. Hence, the system was only capable of measuring HR in animals that showed little or no activity and in the absence of rumen contractions. Reliability of this ‘stationary HR’ measurement was confirmed with a second independent measurement of HR detected by an electrocardiogram in a domestic sheep (Ovis aries)., 4. In addition, we developed an algorithm to correctly classify an animal as ‘active’ or ‘at rest’ during each 3-min interval from the output of the activity sensors. Comparison with direct behavioural observations on free-ranging Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) showed that 87\% of intervals were classified correctly., 5. First results from applications of this new technique in free-ranging Alpine ibex underlined its suitability for reliable and long-term monitoring of physiological and behavioural parameters in ruminants under harsh field conditions. With the battery settings and measurement cycles used in this study, we achieved a system lifetime of approximately 2 years.},

    abstract     = {The tuco-tuco Ctenomys aff. knighti is a subterranean rodent which inhabits a semi-arid area in Northwestern Argentina. Although they live in underground burrows where environmental cycles are attenuated, they display robust, 24 h locomotor activity rhythms that are synchronized by light/dark cycles, both in laboratory and field conditions. The underground environment also poses energetic challenges (e.g. high-energy demands of digging, hypoxia, high humidity, low food availability) that have motivated thermoregulation studies in several subterranean rodent species. By using chronobiological protocols, the present work aims to contribute towards these studies by exploring day-night variations of thermoregulatory functions in tuco-tucos, starting with body temperature and its temporal relationship to locomotor activity. Animals showed daily, 24 h body temperature rhythms that persisted even in constant darkness and temperature, synchronizing to a daily light/dark cycle, with highest values occurring during darkness hours. The range of oscillation of body temperature was slightly lower than those reported for similar-sized and dark-active rodents. Most rhythmic parameters, such as period and phase, did not change upon removal of the running wheel. Body temperature and locomotor activity rhythms were robustly associated in time. The former persisted even after removal of the acute effects of intense activity on body temperature by a statistical method. Finally, regression gradients between body temperature and activity were higher in the beginning of the night, suggesting day-night variation in thermal conductance and heat production. Consideration of these day-night variations in thermoregulatory processes is beneficial for further studies on thermoregulation and energetics of subterranean rodents.},

    abstract     = {Black bears hibernate for 5 to 7 months a year and, during this time, do not eat, drink, urinate, or defecate. We measured metabolic rate and body temperature in hibernating black bears and found that they suppress metabolism to 25\% of basal rates while regulating body temperature from 30° to 36°C, in multiday cycles. Heart rates were reduced from 55 to as few as 9 beats per minute, with profound sinus arrhythmia. After returning to normal body temperature and emerging from dens, bears maintained a reduced metabolic rate for up to 3 weeks. The pronounced reduction and delayed recovery of metabolic rate in hibernating bears suggest that the majority of metabolic suppression during hibernation is independent of lowered body temperature. Hibernating black bears suppress their metabolic rate to 25\% of normal, but only slightly reduce their body temperature. Hibernating black bears suppress their metabolic rate to 25\% of normal, but only slightly reduce their body temperature.},

Our model shows that nocturnality is typically beneficial when predation risk is higher during the day than during the night, but this is reversed by the energetic benefit of diurnality when food becomes scarce. Empirical testing under semi-natural conditions revealed that the daily timing of activity and rest in mice exposed to manipulations in energy availability and perceived predation risk is in line with the model’s predictions. Low food availability and decreased perceived daytime predation risk promote diurnal activity patterns. Overall, our results identify temporal niche switching in small mammals as a strategy to maximise survival in response to environmental changes in food availability and perceived predation risk.},

    abstract     = {To study the neurophysiology of large-scale spatial cognition, we analyzed the neuronal activity of navigating homing pigeons. This is not possible using conventional radio-telemetry suitable for short distances only. Therefore we developed a miniaturized data logger (“neurologger”) that can be carried by a homing pigeon on its back, in conjunction with a micro-global position system (GPS) logger recording the spatial position of the bird. In its present state, the neurologger permits recording from up to eight single-ended or differential electrodes in a walking or flying pigeon. Inputs from eight independent channels are preamplified, band-pass filtered, and directed to an eight-channel, 10-bit analog-digital converter of the microcontroller storing data on a “Multimedia” or “Secure Digital” card. For electroencephalography (EEG), the logger permits simultaneous recordings of up to eight channels during maximally 47 h, depending on memory, while single unit activity from two channels can be stored over 9 h. The logger permits single unit separation from recorded multiunit signals. The neurologger with GPS represents a better alternative to telemetry that will eventually permit to record neuronal activity during cognitive and innate behavior of many species moving freely in their habitats but will also permit automated high-throughput screening of EEG in the laboratory.},

    abstract     = {In mice circadian body temperature curves are masked due to the effect of motor activity. However, body temperature will not immediately reflect activity, but rather the integrated activity over IT minutes (integration time) and after a certain delay (lag), and the sensitivity to such masking may change throughout the circadian cycle. The aims of the present investigation were to estimate IT and lag, to quantify the effect of motor activity on body temperature at different times of the day, and, using these results, to draw temperature curves that are closer to the endogenous one. Activity and body temperature of adult male laboratory mice were recorded telemetrically at 10-min intervals. Animals were housed in air-conditioned rooms (T = 22+/-2 degrees C; relative humidity: 55-65\%) with a light-dark cycle of 12 h:12 h (light from 0700 to 1900 hours) and food and water available ad lib. The diurnal activity and body temperature rhythms were similar with a main maximum during the dark time and a secondary maximum immediately following lights-on. Nearly all changes of activity were reflected in body temperature. IT and lag were established on the basis of the best correlation between body temperature and activity (overlapping 4-h sections of 12 days) for all combinations of IT from 10 to 90 min and lag from 0 to 50 min (10-min steps each). The overall means of IT and lag were 40 and 0 min, respectively. During the dark time the values were somewhat larger, but not significantly so. The correlation between activity and body temperature was significantly better in the light time compared to the dark time. The sensitivity of the body temperature to changes in activity was investigated by linear regression analysis for every hour over 12 days (IT = 40 min, lag = 0 min). The gradients assessed by regression analysis showed a diurnal pattern with maximal values during the light time (p {$<$} 0.01). Thus, body temperature was raised by activity more during the light time (minimum of body temperature and activity) than during the dark time. The intercepts showed a nearly sinusoidal diurnal pattern with maximal values in the middle of the dark time. Accepting that the intercepts correspond to zero activity at a certain time of day, one might use them to get a curve that is closer to the endogenous body temperature rhythm. Mechanisms (circadian and thermoregulatory) that might cause the diurnally changing sensitivity of body temperature to activity are discussed.},

The circadian thermoenergetics (CTE) hypothesis postulates that switches in activity timing are a response to energetic challenges; daytime activity reduces thermoregulatory costs by consolidating activity to the warmest part of the day. Studying wild animals under both captive and natural conditions can increase understanding of how temporal activity patterns are shaped by the environment and could serve as a test of the CTE hypothesis. We estimated the effects of activity timing on energy expenditure for the tuco-tuco by combining laboratory measurements of metabolic rate with environmental temperature records in both winter and summer. We showed that, in winter, there would be considerable energy savings if activity is allocated at least partially during daylight, lending support to the CTE hypothesis. In summer, the impact of activity timing on energy expenditure is small, suggesting that during this season other factors, such as predation risk, water balance, and social interaction, may have more important roles than energetics in the determination of activity time.},

  abstract = {We review the current state of research on vegetation heterogeneity in the Monte Desert at scales varying from landscape to intra-patch. Different factors are related to vegetation heterogeneity at every scale. At a coarse scale (i.e. landscapes and communities) vegetation heterogeneity is commonly determined by abiotic factors, whereas biotic interactions usually influence fine scale (patch, intrapatch) heterogeneity. Communities are distributed at the landscape scale according to differences in precipitation, topography and soil attributes. On the other hand, there is evidence that the spatial pattern of plant patches within communities is determined by runon –runoff processes, although biotic influences such as grazing can induce changes in the spatial pattern of patches when plant cover is strongly reduced. In the same way, at patch and intrapatch scales, biotic interactions (i.e. plant –plant interactions, grazing) determine the size and the species composition of plant patches as well as the distribution of species inside plant patches. However, the mechanisms operating behind such biotic interactions at small scales are commonly related to plant-induced changes in the physical environment. We also found evidence of cross-scale interactions, feedbacks, and non-linear effects such as those induced by grazing disturbance. Our analysis showed some regional differences in patterns and processes related to vegetation heterogeneity along the Monte Desert which can be ascribed to climatic and taxonomic variation among areas. Although information about vegetation heterogeneity and its causes and consequences in the Monte Desert is abundant, some areas where knowledge is scarce are detailed.},

  abstract = {Voles are small herbivorous rodents that can display both circadian activity rhythms (\textasciitilde 24-h periodicity) and ultradian activity rhythms (\textasciitilde 1- to 6-h periodicity). Ultradian rhythms are observed on an individual level, but also in synchronized populations. Ultradian rhythm period has been suggested to be influenced by energy balance, but the underlying mechanisms of ultradian rhythmicity are poorly understood. We manipulated energy balance by implementing the “work-for-food” paradigm, in which small rodents are exposed to increasing levels of food scarcity at different ambient temperatures in the laboratory. Photoperiodical spring-programmed voles on high workload changed their nocturnal circadian activity and body temperature rhythm to ultradian patterns, indicating that a negative energy balance induces ultradian rhythmicity. This interpretation was confirmed by the observation that ultradian patterns arose earlier at low temperatures. Interestingly, a positive relationship between ultradian period length and workload was observed in tundra voles. Spectral analysis revealed that the power of ultradian rhythmicity increased at high workload, whereas the circadian component of running wheel activity decreased. This study shows that the balance between circadian and ultradian rhythmicity is determined by energy balance, confirming flexible circadian and ultradian rhythms in females and males of 2 different vole species: the common vole (Microtus arvalis) and the tundra vole (Microtus oeconomus).},
