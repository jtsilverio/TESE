@article{brown2013,
    abstract     = {Behavior is an important mechanism of evolution and it is paid for through energy expenditure. Nevertheless, field biologists can rarely observe animals for more than a fraction of their daily activities and attempts to quantify behavior for modeling ecological processes often exclude cryptic yet important behavioral events. Over the past few years, an explosion of research on remote monitoring of animal behavior using acceleration sensors has smashed the decades-old limits of observational studies. Animal-attached accelerometers measure the change in velocity of the body over time and can quantify fine-scale movements and body postures unlimited by visibility, observer bias, or the scale of space use. Pioneered more than a decade ago, application of accelerometers as a remote monitoring tool has recently surged thanks to the development of more accessible hardware and software. It has been applied to more than 120 species of animals to date. Accelerometer measurements are typically collected in three dimensions of movement at very high resolution ({$>$}10~Hz), and have so far been applied towards two main objectives. First, the patterns of accelerometer waveforms can be used to deduce specific behaviors through animal movement and body posture. Second, the variation in accelerometer waveform measurements has been shown to correlate with energy expenditure, opening up a suite of scientific questions in species notoriously difficult to observe in the wild. To date, studies of wild aquatic species outnumber wild terrestrial species and analyses of social behaviors are particularly few in number. Researchers of domestic and captive species also tend to report methodology more thoroughly than those studying species in the wild. There are substantial challenges to getting the most out of accelerometers, including validation, calibration, and the management and analysis of large quantities of data. In this review, we illustrate how accelerometers work, provide an overview of the ecological questions that have employed accelerometry, and highlight the emerging best practices for data acquisition and analysis. This tool offers a level of detail in behavioral studies of free-ranging wild animals that has previously been impossible to achieve and, across scientific disciplines, it improves understanding of the role of behavioral mechanisms in ecological and evolutionary processes.},

    abstract     = {To advance our understanding of biological processes we often plan our experiments based on published data. This can be confusing though, as data from experiments performed in a laboratory environment are sometimes different from, or completely opposite to, findings from similar experiments performed in the “real world”. In this mini-review, we discuss instances where results from laboratory experiments differ as a result of laboratory housing conditions, and where they differ from results gathered in the field environment. Experiments involving endocrinology and behavior appear to be particularly susceptible to influence from the environment in which they are performed. As such, we have attempted to promote discussion of the influence of housing environment on the reproductive axis, circadian biology and behavior, immune function, stress biology, neuroplasticity and photoperiodism. For example, why should a rodent species be diurnal in one housing environment yet nocturnal in another? Are data that are gathered from experiments in the laboratory applicable to the field environment, and vice-versa? We hope not only to highlight the need for experiments in both lab and field when looking at complex biological systems, but also to promote frank discussion of discordant data. Perhaps, just as study of individual variation has been gaining momentum in recent years, data from variation between experimental arenas can provide us with novel lines of research.},

    abstract     = {Living organisms anticipate the seasons by tracking the proportion of light and darkness hours within a day—photoperiod. The limits of photoperiod measurement can be investigated in the subterranean rodents tuco-tucos (Ctenomys aff. knighti), which inhabit dark underground tunnels. Their exposure to light is sporadic and, remarkably, results from their own behavior of surface emergence. Thus, we investigated the endogenous and exogenous regulation of this behavior and its consequences to photoperiod measurement. In the field, animals carrying biologgers displayed seasonal patterns of daily surface emergence, exogenously modulated by temperature. In the laboratory, experiments with constant lighting conditions revealed the endogenous regulation of seasonal activity by the circadian clock, which has a multi-oscillatory structure. Finally, mathematical modeling corroborated that tuco-tuco’s light exposure across the seasons is sufficient for photoperiod encoding. Together, our results elucidate the interrelationship between the circadian clock and temperature in shaping seasonal light exposure patterns that convey photoperiod information in an extreme photic environment.},

Here, we present rethomics, a set of R packages that unifies the analysis of behavioural datasets in an efficient and flexible manner. rethomics offers a computational solution to storing, manipulating and visualising large amounts of behavioural data. We propose it as a tool to bridge the gap between behavioural biology and data sciences, thus connecting computational and behavioural scientists. rethomics comes with a extensive documentation as well as a set of both practical and theoretical tutorials (available at https://rethomics.github.io).},

    abstract  = {Time as an ecological niche variable or “temporal niche” can be defined in the context of the most prominent environmental cycles, including the tidal cycle, the lunar day and month, the solar day, and the earth year. For the current review, we focus on the 24-h domain generated through the earth’s rotation around its axis (solar day). The daily environmental cycles of light and temperature are a dominant ecological factor generating a variety of adaptations among animals. In this review, we describe these adaptations with a special focus on the visual system and on the adaptive plasticity of activity patterns. Our goals are: (1) Underscore the importance of the 24-h time axis as critical variable in the ecological niche. (2) Highlight cases of temporal niche switches at the evolutionary timescale (phylogenetic level). (3) Review temporal niche switching within an individual’s lifespan. (4) Evaluate possible underlying mechanisms for temporal niche switching. (5) Describe a new hypothesis of circadian thermoenergetics which may explain several cases of temporal niche switching in mammals. With this, we hope to inspire experiments under natural conditions or more complex laboratory environments, aimed to reveal environmental factors and mechanisms underlying specific temporal programs.},

    abstract     = {Dipodomys microps, D. merriami, and Perognatlius longitnembrisspend most of their lives solitarily and in the ground, coming out onto the surface only at night and foraging for as little as an hour. However, they are active within their burrows throughout the day, seldom remaining motionless for more than half an hour at a time during the warmer parts of the year. All three species rest at positions in their burrows which are generally at the nearest of available temperaturesto the lower end of thermal neutrality,but not warmer than 30? C. To do this, they occupy differentdepths at differentseasons and in some cases differenttimes of day. Daily vertical movements are most common in P. longimembris,because it maintains tunnels as near as 1 cm from the surface, where daily fluctuations in temperature are profound. In late fall, winter, and early spring all three species occupy nests, which serve to reduce metabolic expenditure. Energetic strategiesdifferinterspecificallyin relation to differencesin body weight among the species: D. microps (56 g), D. merriami (35 g), and P. longimenmbris(7 g). The amount of surface activity in the populations and the frequency of movement measured in individuals decrease during colder parts of the year. This decrease is most apparent in the smaller species, and is related to the decreasing success at foraging later in the season and the increasing costs of metabolism at colder temperatures. Surface activity in D. microps and D. mnerriamciontinues throughoutthe year, at temperaturesmeasured as low as -190 C. However, for P. iongimembristhe costs of foraging in winter usually far outweigh the yield, and the mice become continuously fossorial for up to 5 months of the year, living on seeds that they have cached in their burrows, and spending a great deal of time in dormancy. Seasonal cycles of body weight and reproduction are not synchronous in D. microps and D. merriami, because of differences in diet and foraging behavior. Dipodomys merriami, which is primarilya seed eater, requires the green vegetation of annual plants to reproduce, and therefore this species increases body weight and reproduces at sporadic intervals according to the unpredictable availability of annuals. Dipodomys inicrops, however, reproduces in a brief,annually consistentperiod because leaves of perennial shrubs are its primary yearround food and water resource. This larger kangaroo rat forages over a smaller area for leaves than D. merriami does for seeds; but D. merriamnri uns 50\% faster, which should compensate for the cost of moving greater distances. Dipodomys microps is most active during the firstpart of the night,but D. merriamibecomes more active during the course of the night as the activityof D. microps decreases. Height and breadth of burrow hillocks and height of shrubs on hillocks were significantlylarger for D. microps than the other species, but height of burrow hillocks and shrubs on them did not differ between D. merriami and P. longimembris. Perognathus longimembris resembles D. inerriami more than it does D. microps in diet and reproductive pattern, but in winters of great food scarcity competition between P. Iongimembrisand D. merriami is reduced by the total absence of P. longimembris from the surface.},

    abstract     = {▪ Abstract\hspace{0.6em} Animal species have evolved different diel activity rhythms that are of adaptive value. Theory suggests that diel temporal partitioning may facilitate coexistence between competitors and between predators and prey. However, relatively few studies demonstrate a temporal shift that is predation- or competition-induced. Recorded shifts are usually within the preferred activity phase of animal species (day or night), although there are some inversions to the opposite phase cycle. Temporal partitioning is not perceived as a common mechanism of coexistence. This rarity has been variously ascribed to theoretical considerations and to the rigidity of time-keeping mechanisms, as well as to other physiological and anatomical traits that may constrain activity patterns. Our decade-long study of spiny mice of rocky deserts demonstrates that, while different factors select for activity patterns, endogenous rhythmicity may be an evolutionary constraint.},

    abstract     = {Daily rhythms of physiology and behaviour are governed by an endogenous timekeeping mechanism (a circadian ‘clock’), with the alternation of environmental light and darkness synchronizing (entraining) these rhythms to the natural day–night cycle. Our knowledge of the circadian system of animals at the molecular, cellular, tissue and organismal levels is remarkable, and we are beginning to understand how each of these levels contributes to the emergent properties and increased complexity of the system as a whole. For the most part, these analyses have been carried out using model organisms in standard laboratory housing, but to begin to understand the adaptive significance of the clock, we must expand our scope to study diverse animal species from different taxonomic groups, showing diverse activity patterns, in their natural environments. The seven papers in this Special Feature of               Proceedings of the Royal Society B               take on this challenge, reviewing the influences of moonlight, latitudinal clines, evolutionary history, social interactions, specialized temporal niches, annual variation and recently appreciated post-transcriptional molecular mechanisms. The papers emphasize that the complexity and diversity of the natural world represent a powerful experimental resource.},

    abstract     = {The tuco-tuco Ctenomys aff. knighti is a subterranean rodent which inhabits a semi-arid area in Northwestern Argentina. Although they live in underground burrows where environmental cycles are attenuated, they display robust, 24 h locomotor activity rhythms that are synchronized by light/dark cycles, both in laboratory and field conditions. The underground environment also poses energetic challenges (e.g. high-energy demands of digging, hypoxia, high humidity, low food availability) that have motivated thermoregulation studies in several subterranean rodent species. By using chronobiological protocols, the present work aims to contribute towards these studies by exploring day-night variations of thermoregulatory functions in tuco-tucos, starting with body temperature and its temporal relationship to locomotor activity. Animals showed daily, 24 h body temperature rhythms that persisted even in constant darkness and temperature, synchronizing to a daily light/dark cycle, with highest values occurring during darkness hours. The range of oscillation of body temperature was slightly lower than those reported for similar-sized and dark-active rodents. Most rhythmic parameters, such as period and phase, did not change upon removal of the running wheel. Body temperature and locomotor activity rhythms were robustly associated in time. The former persisted even after removal of the acute effects of intense activity on body temperature by a statistical method. Finally, regression gradients between body temperature and activity were higher in the beginning of the night, suggesting day-night variation in thermal conductance and heat production. Consideration of these day-night variations in thermoregulatory processes is beneficial for further studies on thermoregulation and energetics of subterranean rodents.},

  abstract = {Circadian clocks are ubiquitous throughout the Tree of Life, being present in organisms from bacteria to mammals. These clocks are generally thought to increase the fitness of organisms by allowing the anticipation of and preparation for the predictable daily changes associated with Earth's rotation. Here we consider what it takes to show that clocks indeed increase fitness and adaptiveness, as well as what bacteria can tell us about the evolution of clocks. We give a historical panorama of the experimental approaches that attempted to demonstrate the adaptive value of circadian clocks and explore current and future experiments that could facilitate an understanding of the adaptiveness of clocks in both intra- and interspecific contexts. Finally, we explain how studying bacteria can generate a greater appreciation and understanding for the general principles of the adaptive value of circadian clocks not only towards the daily cycle but also for the seasonal cycle, from both a past and future evolutionary perspective.},
