# Annual changes in daily activity patterns in free-living tuco-tucos

This is a repository for my masters' thesis. This thesis was presented to _departamento de fisiologia - IB-USP_. It was done using R v4.1.2.
 
# Main directories

- `00_submitted-pdfs`: Submitted PDF files. Knitted from the bookdown template located in `05_writing`.
- `01_data`: Data directory. The processed data is provided in the repo. The raw data, however, needs to be copied separetly.
- `02_data_processing`: Data processing scripts used to process and merge acelerometer and luximiter raw data. These scripts generates the file `01_data/activity_processed/tuco_processed.rds`.
- `03_analysis`: Analysis scripts used to run EDA, HMM models, statistical tests and generate the appendix plots (e.g. actograms, weather, vegetation, daylength).
- `04_figures`: Figures generated by the analysis scripts plus other images such as the introduction diagram, maps and tuco-tuco's photo.
- `05_writing`: _Bookdown_ based structured to write and generate the final thesis document using markdown, pandoc and LaTeX. I used `https://github.com/COPPE-UFRJ/coppedown` as a base bookdown template and modified specific details to follow the IB-USP template.
- `requirements.txt`: Script with all necessary packages used in the markdown and analysis documents.
- `tuco-tuco-activity.Rproj`: Rstudio project.
